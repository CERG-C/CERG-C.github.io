This part of the exercise assumes that you have already installed both QGIS and Q-LavHA . The Q-LavHA user manual contains some important information about how to configure the model and the data, so we encourage you to have a look at it at some point. Objectives Review the theory behind Q-LavHA . Understand the main assumptions behind the use of the model. Perform probabilistic lava flow modeling for several vents in La Palma. Account for the uncertainty in vent locations in hazard assessments. Theory behind Q-LavHA Flow direction The starting philosophy behind Q-LavHA is similar to the analysis performed for the path of steepest descent approach: using the DEM, the model will try to estimate where the flow will go next based on the maximum \\(\\Delta h\\) of the surrounding pixels. However, Q-LavHA uses a probabilistic approach to estimate this flow direction. Firstly, as we saw, a lava flow is a Non-Newtonian fluid with yield strength, which means that it can escape the steepest path and propagate laterally, fill depressions and overcome topographical obstacles. To account for that, Q-LavHA introduces 2 corrective factors: \\(H_c\\) , representing the flow thickness . \\(H_p\\) , representing the ability of a flow to inflate . Together, these two parameters help avoiding the modelled flow getting stuck in topographic low and will allow it to spread laterally, as we saw the 2021 flow of La Palma was able to do. Secondly, the initial estimation of path of steepest descent is performed stochastically similarly to what we previously looked at . Conceptually, one Q-LavHA output is constituted by the simulation of thousands of lava flows (1500 by default). Each lava flow simulation applies a path of steepest descent approach, but the selection of the next pixel is performed slightly differently: At each new pixel, the \\(H_c\\) and \\(H_p\\) corrections are applied to the active pixel according to Figure 1. Instead of selecting the pixel with the largest \\(|\\Delta h|\\) as previously seen , Q-LavHA assigns a relative probability of flow inundation to each surrounding pixel (see box below). Using a random number generator, Q-LavHA stochastically sample which pixel will be inundated next. With this approach, the pixel with the largest \\(|\\Delta h|\\) has the highest probability of being inundated next, but other pixel also have a non-null probability of inundation. Path of steepest descent in Q-LavHA By default, Q-LavHA computes a relative probability across the 8 surrounding pixels using \\(\\Delta h^2\\) according to: \\[ P_i^2 = \\frac{(\\Delta h_i)^2}{\\sum_{j=1}^{8} (\\Delta h_i)^2}, i=1,2,\\ldots,8 \\] If potential topographic obstacles are not overcome by the application of \\(H_c\\) and \\(H_p\\) around the 8 surrounding pixels, Q-LavHA extends its search to the next 16 surrounding pixels. Q-LavHA then transforms these relative probabilities into a cumulative probability function \\(S_i\\) : \\[ S_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{i} P_j, i=1,2,\\ldots,8 \\] A random number \\(rnd\\) is then drawn in the \\([0, 1[\\) interval, and used to select the corresponding pixel in the range \\([S_{i-1}, Si[\\) : \\[ S_{i-1} \\leq rnd \\leq S_i, i=1,2,\\ldots,8 \\] Figure 1: Topographic corrections applied in `Q-LavHA`. Flow length Flow length is a critical metrics of lava flow hazard. However, since it depends on a complex interaction between eruption conditions at the source, flow rheology and topography through time and space, modelling the case-per-case physics of each flow is unrealistic in hazard assessment contexts. For this reason, Q-LavHA proposes three alternatives to compute maximum flow length: A maximum user defined length, using either Euclidean or Manhattan distances. A decreasing probability function based on existing flow databases. The cooling-limited flow model FLOWGO 2 . Lava flow distance As you can see from the geological map of La Palma , most historical flows on the island have reached the sea, so we will consider here that the flow distance is of limited importance. This assumption is however invalid in most cases. The probability function option allows you define a probability of flow length based on a mean and standard deviation of known lava flows length, which is a convenient way to treat this parameter probabilistically. Refer to the original paper 1 for more information. Probability of flow inundation As previously seen , probability of lava flow inundation \\(P\\) at a given pixel \\(x, y\\) is generally computed as the number of inundation counts \\(n_i\\) normalised by the number of runs \\(N_r\\) : \\[ P(x,y) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{r}}n_{i}}{N_{r}} \\] Where \\(N_{r}\\) is the total number of runs and \\(n_{i}\\) is defined as: \\[ n_{i} = \\bigg\\{ ^{1,\\ if\\ inundation} _{0,\\ otherwise} \\] Depending on the modeling options adopted, Q-LavHA will slightly modify this approach. Refer to the original paper 1 for more information. Exercise Install Q-LavHA Start by making sure that Q-LavHA has been properly installed according to this guide . You should see this icon in the toolbar. In the Lava Flow exercise layer group in QGIS , activate the Vents Exercise layer. Running Q-LavHA for single vents These vents correspond to those indicated in the Table below. Q-LavHA requires projected UTM coordinates , which are shown in the Easting and Northing columns ( x and y columns, respectively). The UTM zone for La Palma is 28N , or EPSG:3268 . Vent Latitude Longitude Easting (m) Northing (m) EPSG Vent 1 -17.83989 28.62507 222340 3169746 32628 Vent 2 -17.86626 28.61262 219728 3168426 32628 Vent 3 -17.84316 28.58782 221922 3165623 32628 Vent 4 -17.81585 28.60777 224646 3167772 32628 Vent 5 -17.84649 28.49699 221357 3155562 32628 Coordinate systems Here, you are provided with input data that all have the same coordinate system . Before modeling lava flows for your own projects, make sure that you first reproject all your data to a unique CRS . Model setup Let's run Q-LavHA for each of the vents defined above. For now, we will assume that we know exactly the vent location. Open the Q-LavHA window, and let's look at the parameters: Vent location tab Lava flow parameter tab Output files tab In the DEM Selection box, select the Data/Lava/DEM_Qlavah.tif . In the DEM selection window, make sure you change the type of files from .asc to .tif . As a Vent Type , choose Point for now. Add the relevant Coordinates . Lava Flow Propagation : This section sets up the behaviour of the lava flow, as described in the theory section. Leave the default values of Hc and Ht . Use the H16 option: This means that the algorithm will first search for a topographic low within the first 8 adjacent pixels, and will extend the search to the next 16 ones if not found. Use Probability to the square Lava Flow Length Constrain : This section defines when a lava flow stops. You can switch between the various options for an illustration of the different behaviours. As discussed above, use a Manhattan Distance with a length of 10000 m . Simulations : Use a Number of iterations of 1500. This represents the number of simulated lava flows, or \\(N_r\\) in the equations above. Set an Output path and a name to the output layers. Save the Parameters . You are now ready to run the simulation! Vent geometry Q-LavHA offers different source geometries, such as a fissure, or a vent opening susceptibility map. The choice of these options depends on the case study, and their use is described in the Q-LavHA user manual . Styling outputs Upon completion of the model run, the output file is directly added to the layer panel. Let's change its visualisation: Open the Layer Properties panel by double-clicking on the output layer in the Layers panel. From the Symbology tab on the left: Under Color Rendering , uncheck the Colorize option. Under Render type , choose Singleband pseudocolor . Set the min and max values to 0 and 0.5, respectively. Change the Color ramp to Magma Click ok. The output file now shows the spatial distribution of inundation probability varying between \\(\\gt 0\\) and \\(0.5\\) (i.e., 50%). Copying layer symbology In QGIS , you can simply copy the display properties of one layer to other layers: In the Layers panel, right-click on the layer you want to copy the style from and select Styles > Copy style . Now right-click on the layer you want to apply to style on and select Styles > Paste style . Analysing results Following this procedure, run Q-LavHA for all the vents specified in the Table above and apply the same symbology. Answer the following questions: Question 1: Single-vent simulations How do modelled flows compare to historical lava flows in terms of length and width? Analyse and discuss the spatial distribution of inundation probability. How do they compare to flow accumulation rasters and the path of steepest descent approach? Where do branching occur? Chose one vent for which you will produce another run with the same parameters as above. Are they exactly the same? If not, why? Compare simulations from vent 2 with the flow outlines of the 2021 eruption. When and where is the model doing a good job? When and where is it not? Why? Using several vents Even in monogenetic vents , one eruptive episode can consist of multiple satellite vents. This was certainly the case for the 2021 eruption of La Palma. In fact, as you can see from the 2021 Vents layer in QGIS , CEMS identified that ~10 vents opened over a 500 x 500 m area. Here, we won't attempt predicting the number or the location of each vent; instead, we will model lava flow inundation from a grid of vents within a surface area and explore how vent location affects the lava flow simulation hazard. (Not) one vent to rule them all You've each been assigned one of the vents defined in the table above. Since this step takes more computational time, please run this procedure only for this vent. Define the area We will define a potential vent opening surface as a 500 x 500 m square centered on the reference coordinates of your attributed vent. Note that UTM coordinates are in meter : you can therefore simply identify the x and y coordinates these four points by addition and subtraction: Lower left corner Lower right corner Upper right corner Upper left corner Model setup From QGIS open Q-LavHA . Most of the parameters should already be filled. Otherwise, you can use the Load parameters option. Set a Distance between vents of 100 m. Since we definerd a 500 x 500 m area, Q-LavHA will therefore model lava flow inundation from 25 vents. Enter the 4 coordinates previously defined. In the Lava Flow Parameter tab, change the Number of Simulations to 500. This will help save some computation time. Make sure you change the output name. Run the model! Analysing results Apply the same methodology to the surface area runs as you did for the point run. Question 2: Vent location uncertainty Compare the run with its single-vent counterpart. How do they differ and why? Prepare your hazard maps Food for thoughts Forecasting the flows from the 2021 eruption Compare the Q-LavHA run with the flow outlines from the 2021 eruption below. Note that the Q-LavHA run was performed using the same 500 x 500 m source area as used above. Q-LavHA runs Flow outlines Question 3: Interpreting hazard forecasts From what you know about both the 2021 eruption and the dynamics of lava flows, compare and discuss the hazard forecast and the actual deposit. What are Q-LavHA 's strengths and limitations? Summary In this exercise, you have: Understood the philosophy behind a probabilistic model for lava flow inundation, Q-LavHA . Assessed the hazard of lava flow inundation using probabilistic modeling. Included the uncertainty on vent location in hazard estimates. Understood the limitations of model predictions when compared to past events. References Mossoux, S., Saey, M., Bartolini, S., Poppe, S., Canters, F., Kervyn, M., 2016.

Over the past years, volcanic crises in Hawaii in 2018, in DRC and La Palma in 2021 have demonstrated the difficulty in managing these long\u2013lasting crises. This is due to the fact that lava flows are governed by complex rheological processes, making their paths hard to predict. As a result, forecasts are often associated with large uncertainties that makes them unusable during crisis management. Does this mean that we are helpless in reducing the risk associated with lava flows? Well, no, not entirely. In this exercise, we will differentiate between various purposes of hazard (and risk!) assessments for different parts of the risk cycle , contrasting between actions taken long before the event during the prevention phase - where the idea here is to plan ahead to reduce the risk - and actions taken short before or during the event in the preparedness and response phases - where the aim is to minimise immediate impacts. We will discuss these concepts throughout the exercise and in the field, but refer to the ADVISE 1 approach for an overview of the risk framework we are applying here. Case-study: La Palma Exercise outline In this exercise, we will look at two complementary approaches to assess the hazard associated with lava flow inundation that are the path of steepest descent and the Q-LavHA model. Path of steepest descent Firstly, we will have a look at how simple hydrological tools can help us estimate the direction of lava flows. The path of steepest descent approach, which estimates flow direction based only on the hydrological properties of the terrain. Despite its simplicity, this is the preferred method used by USGS and Hawaii Volcano Observatory (HVO) to communicate with stakeholders during lava flow crises. Q-LavHA Secondly, we will test the Q-LavHA model, which goes one step forward in attempting to predict lava flow inundation using some stochastic strategies to estimate the uncertainty associated with lava flow emplacement processes. Objectives With this exercise, using two types of approaches to estimate the hazard associated with lava flow inundation, you will: Compare deterministic and probabilistic approaches. Understand the value of uncertainty quantification and its role in risk communication. Appreciate the difference between short-term hazard communication during crises and long-term hazard assessment for risk mitigation. Communicating uncertainties during lava flow crises Since the beginning of the Pu\u2018u\u2018\u014d\u2018\u014d eruption in 1983 to its end in 2018 , the Big Island of Hawaii has been periodically affected by lava flow crises. These repeated crises have provided important lessons on how to communicate hazard uncertainties during crises. During the 2014 crisis, the flow field was dangerously heading towards the town of P\u0101hoa. Under pressure from decision makers, HVO attempted to provide a forecast and estimated that the flow might reach the town of P\u0101hoa within a few to tens of days... only that the media only reported the \"a few\" days, creating panic amongst the community. HVO realised the difficulty in communicating such a large uncertainty in operational activities and decided to cease providing forecasts. Instead, they reverted back to the steepest descent method which, although over-simplifying complex flow-emplacement processes, has the benefit of being transparent. In addition, HVO conducted meetings with stakeholders, agencies and the public, where they explained the limitations encountered when modeling lava flows. This combination of the use of a simplistic model with outreach events proved out to be the most efficient communication procedure and contributed to both increasing the trust in HVO and efficiently reducing the risk 2 3 .

Assessing the timing of lava inundation is still an active topic of research, so we will restrict ourselves to estimating the surface area of flows. For this, we first need to review some of the physical concepts behind the fluid dynamics of lava flows. Objectives Understand basic rheological properties of lavas. Review the main emplacement processes. Identify and appreciate the sources of uncertainties in lava flow modelling. When and why do lavas flow? Credits This section is largely inspired by the great rheology class of Tom Shea at the University of Hawai'i. Some definitions Shear stress The shear stress \\(\\tau\\) is the load stress applied to a fluid \u2192 i.e., the force per unit area acting in the direction and parallel to the flow surface: \\[ \\tau = \\rho g h \\times sin(\\alpha)\\ [Pa = Nm^{-2}] \\] Strain rate The strain rate \\(\\epsilon\\) is the rate of deformation when a shear stress is applied \u2192 i.e., velocity gradient: \\[ \\epsilon = \\frac{dV}{dZ}\\ [s^{-1}] \\] Yield strength The yield strength \\(\\tau _0\\) is the shear stress above which deformation begins : \\[ \\tau_0 = \\rho g h_0 \\times sin(\\alpha)\\ [Pa = Nm^{-2}] \\] Viscosity The viscosity \\(\\eta\\) is the resistance of fluid to flow when shear stress is applied: \\[ \\eta = \\frac{d\\tau}{d\\epsilon}\\ [Pa\\ s = Nm^{-2}s] \\] When does lava flow? From Figure 1: \u2192 Flow occurs when driving forces (here = gravitational forces) > resistive forces \u2192 Response/behaviour of the fluid depends on its rheology Figure 1: Left: Summary of driving forces. Right: Types of fluids. Note that on the right plot, the slope of at each point of the curve represents the flow's viscosity. Credit: Tom Shae. Flow rheology Newtonian fluids Newtonian fluids will start to flow/deform when an infinitesimally low shear stress is applied The relationship between the applied force (\u2192 shear stress ) and rate of deformation (\u2192 strain rate ) is linear Non-newtonian fluid A fluid is non-newtonian when one of these conditions is met: The relationship between shear stress and strain rate is non-linear A yield strength must be exceeded before flowing occurs, after which the shear stress / strain rate relationship can be linear or not Amongst non-newtonian fluids: Fluids with variable shear stress / strain rate include pseudoplastic or dilatant fluids Dilatant fluids: apparent viscosity increases with increasing shear rate \u2192 shear thickening fluids Pseudoplastic fluids: apparent viscosity decreases with increasing shear rate \u2192 shear thinning fluids Bingham fluids are a special type of non-newtonian fluids characterized by a yield strength and a linear shear stress / strain rate relationship Lava flows Lava flows are typically non-newtonian , pseudoplastic fluids with a yield strength . Question: flow rheology Think of a slope. If you drop a newtonian fluid (i.e., no yield strength) on it, it will immediately start flowing, whereas non-newtonian fluids with a yield strength will require some help. Can you think of any fluids that would behave like these? Solution Water is a newtonian fluid with no yield strength Toothpaste is a non-newtonian fluids with a yield strength What parameters can help lava flows to overcome yield strength? Solution Effusion rate Flow thickness Slope Dynamics of lava flows Let's try and put these physical concepts in the perspective of actual lava flows. Look at these videos, and describe them in terms of: Flow shape, geometry, morphology, texture Colour (as an indicator to which physical parameter?) Velocity and flow rate? Flow type Video 1 Video 2 Lava channel Video 1a Video 1b 'A'\u0101 Video 1a Video 1b P\u0101hoehoe Video 3a Video 3b Lava flows properties What do you see? From the parameters described above, what can you infer on the underlying processes? How would you describe the advance rates of each lava flow type? What distance from the vent is each flow? Where do you think the local effusion rate is the highest? Physical modelling as a hazard tool These videos illustrate the variety and the complexity of processes controlling the spatio-temporal evolution of lava flows. Attempting to sum up all processes taking place in lava flow emplacement is difficult, but here are some of the higher-level parameters 1 2 3 4 : Advance rate : Volumetric effusion rate Proximity to the vent Flow length : Eruption rate (both magnitude and steadiness) Slope traversed Extent of topographic confinement Initial lava temperature and rheological properties Emplacement conditions (open channel or insulating tube) No model is yet able to capture the ensemble of these parameters, and therefore each model relies on different assumptions 5 . For instance, the FLOWGO model 6 describes the physics behind the down-flow evolution of thermal and rheological properties of lava flows, but assumes a channel-contained lava flow. Other models, such as Q-LavHA 7 or MrLavaLoba 8 bypass the use of physics and describe the emplacement of lava flows as stochastic processes. Understanding both i) the issues behind the studied problem (e.g., process-driven research vs hazard assessment) and ii) the limitations behind numerical models is key to identify and adopt the appropriate modelling approach. Modeling natural phenomena Don't forget the famous aphorism: All models are wrong, but some are useful! The 2016 eruption of Pu\u2018u \u2018\u014c\u2018\u014d As already discussed, the combination of all these parameters make lava flow modeling a complex problem associated with large uncertainties . One critical aspect of risk management is that these lava flow crises are often long-lasting , and predicting their spatio-temporal evolution is currently impossible beyond a time window of a few hours to days. This is especially true for p\u0101hoehoe flow fields , where random processes are important 1 . Let's use some downward counterfactual thinking on the 2016 lava flow of Pu\u2018u \u2018\u014c\u2018\u014d in Hawai'i to appreciate the complexity of predicting the evolution of such an event. Fortunately, this event did not affect any settlements. Here is a summary of the chronology: Date Observation May 24 Onset of summit eruption at Pu\u2018u \u2018\u014c\u2018\u014d June 08 Development of a compound lava flow going SE June 08-28 Lava flow emplacement as p\u0101hoehoe June 28-30 Lava reached the pali, transition to 'A'\u0101 June 30 Onset of development of compound p\u0101hoehoe on coastal plain July 26 Ocean entry, 11 km away from source Until sept Widening of the flow field Hawaii 2016 flow Toes Lava tube Morphology transition Figure 2: Overview of the Big Island of Hawai'i. Figure 3: Map of the 61g flow. Figure 4: Early emplacement of a new p\u0101hoehoe flow as \"toes\" (Picture: S. Biass). Figure 5: Lava tube developed in a mature p\u0101hoehoe field (Picture: S. Biass). Figure 6: View of the Pali (meaning \"cliff\" in Hawaiian). At the top, the flow is p\u0101hoehoe, but transitions to 'A'\u0101/open channel on higher slopes. At the bottom of the Pali, the flow reverts back to p\u0101hoehoe (Picture: S. Biass). Evolution of the flow field The evolution of the p\u0101hoehoe flow field was studied during the eruption using structure-from-motion from helicopter 9 , from which 3D maps of topographic and thermal features were created. These maps capture the spatio-temporal evolution of the dynamics of lava flow emplacement and highlight the difficulty in predicting the ensemble of controlling processes. Topographic evolution Thermal evolution Steepest descent Figure 7 illustrates how compound p\u0101hoehoe lava flows alter the topography, which affects the emplacement of subsequent flow units. Figure 7: Elevation changes calculated as the difference with the pre-flow DEM 9 . Figure 8 shows the thermal evolution of the surface of compound p\u0101hoehoe lava flows. The initial, uniformly high surface temperature gradually decreases, which reflects the thermal insulation of the flow and the development of lava tubes. Lava tubes efficiently transport lava from the source to the front with little cooling, and drives the down-flow surface breakouts observed on 08/19. Figure 8: Thermal evolution of the flow's surface 9 . Figure 9 shows the evolution of the prediction efficiency of the path of steepest descent approach as a consequence of the evolution of the DEM and the development of a tube system. Figure 9: Evolution of the stream network and comparison to the flow outlines and tube system 9 . Conclusion Fundamental processes governing lava flow emplacement are numerous and complicated by feedbacks and non-linear interactions occurring at various temporal and spatial scales. The development of predictive models are impeded by two sources of uncertainties: On the one hand, either the full range of parameters to accurately describe emplacement processes are rarely available (e.g., channelised flows) or physical models do not exist (e.g., p\u0101hoehoe flows); this can be referred to as an epistemic uncertainty; On the other hand, stochastic rather than physical processes dominate the emplacement dynamics (e.g., p\u0101hoehoe flows); this can be referred to as an aleatoric uncertainty. This limited ability to predict the evolution of lava flow crises result in high uncertainties during the management of long-lasting lava flow crises. In this context, lava flow hazard assessments should always be achieved with: The understanding of the limitations of each models and their sources of uncertainties ; A framework to quantify and communicate uncertainties, which is out next topic. Summary Lava flows are non-newtonian fluids with a yield strength . Their emplacement is controlled by source conditions , topographic control and rheological properties . No unified model for flow emplacement exists, and modelling approaches follow two main directions: physical and stochastic strategies. References Harris, A.J.L., Rowland, S.K., 2015.

One critical aspect of risk management is that these lava flow crises are often long-lasting , and predicting their spatio-temporal evolution is currently impossible beyond a time window of a few hours to days. This is especially true for p\u0101hoehoe flow fields , where random processes are important 1 . Let's use some downward counterfactual thinking on the 2016 lava flow of Pu\u2018u \u2018\u014c\u2018\u014d in Hawai'i to appreciate the complexity of predicting the evolution of such an event. Fortunately, this event did not affect any settlements. Here is a summary of the chronology: Date Observation May 24 Onset of summit eruption at Pu\u2018u \u2018\u014c\u2018\u014d June 08 Development of a compound lava flow going SE June 08-28 Lava flow emplacement as p\u0101hoehoe June 28-30 Lava reached the pali, transition to 'A'\u0101 June 30 Onset of development of compound p\u0101hoehoe on coastal plain July 26 Ocean entry, 11 km away from source Until sept Widening of the flow field Hawaii 2016 flow Toes Lava tube Morphology transition Figure 2: Overview of the Big Island of Hawai'i. Figure 3: Map of the 61g flow. Figure 4: Early emplacement of a new p\u0101hoehoe flow as \"toes\" (Picture: S. Biass). Figure 5: Lava tube developed in a mature p\u0101hoehoe field (Picture: S. Biass). Figure 6: View of the Pali (meaning \"cliff\" in Hawaiian). At the top, the flow is p\u0101hoehoe, but transitions to 'A'\u0101/open channel on higher slopes. At the bottom of the Pali, the flow reverts back to p\u0101hoehoe (Picture: S. Biass).","title":"The 2016 eruption of Pu\u2018u \u2018\u014c\u2018\u014d"},{"location":"Hazard_lava_modeling/#evolution-of-the-flow-field","text":"The evolution of the p\u0101hoehoe flow field was studied during the eruption using structure-from-motion from helicopter 9 , from which 3D maps of topographic and thermal features were created. These maps capture the spatio-temporal evolution of the dynamics of lava flow emplacement and highlight the difficulty in predicting the ensemble of controlling processes. Topographic evolution Thermal evolution Steepest descent Figure 7 illustrates how compound p\u0101hoehoe lava flows alter the topography, which affects the emplacement of subsequent flow units. Figure 7: Elevation changes calculated as the difference with the pre-flow DEM 9 . Figure 8 shows the thermal evolution of the surface of compound p\u0101hoehoe lava flows. The initial, uniformly high surface temperature gradually decreases, which reflects the thermal insulation of the flow and the development of lava tubes. Lava tubes efficiently transport lava from the source to the front with little cooling, and drives the down-flow surface breakouts observed on 08/19. Figure 8: Thermal evolution of the flow's surface 9 . Figure 9 shows the evolution of the prediction efficiency of the path of steepest descent approach as a consequence of the evolution of the DEM and the development of a tube system.

The development of predictive models are impeded by two sources of uncertainties: On the one hand, either the full range of parameters to accurately describe emplacement processes are rarely available (e.g., channelised flows) or physical models do not exist (e.g., p\u0101hoehoe flows); this can be referred to as an epistemic uncertainty; On the other hand, stochastic rather than physical processes dominate the emplacement dynamics (e.g., p\u0101hoehoe flows); this can be referred to as an aleatoric uncertainty. This limited ability to predict the evolution of lava flow crises result in high uncertainties during the management of long-lasting lava flow crises. In this context, lava flow hazard assessments should always be achieved with: The understanding of the limitations of each models and their sources of uncertainties ; A framework to quantify and communicate uncertainties, which is out next topic.","title":" Conclusion"},{"location":"Hazard_lava_modeling/#summary","text":"Lava flows are non-newtonian fluids with a yield strength . Their emplacement is controlled by source conditions , topographic control and rheological properties .

DEM are raster datasets containing an elevation value at each pixel, which capture the morphology of the Earth's surface. Global DEM datasets such as SRTM or ASTER are usually produced from the ISS or satellite imagery, but higher-definition datasets can be produced from airborne LiDAR missions or structure-from-motion from UAVs . Here, we will use a DEM with a resolution of 25 m covering the island of La Palma created by the Cartogr\u00e1fica de Canarias, GRAFCAN (updated the 4 February 2021, available at https://opendata.sitcan.es/). Using only a DEM, hydrological analyses can help establishing a surface water system model that we can use to constrain some surface hydrological processes, including likely flow direction or drainage basins . It is therefore extensively used in land-use planning to estimate potentially flooding areas, or to design proposed drainage systems and facilities. Since lava flows are confined by topography, flow paths can be broadly predicted from DEM once the vent location is identified. Here, we will use this workflow to get a general idea of the possible lava flow paths in La Palma: flowchart LR A[Flow accumulation] --> B[Stream network] B --> C[Drainage basins] Several softwares propose implementations of hydrological analyses including QGIS , Matlab and ArcGIS . Here, we have pre-computed the important datasets for you, which are contained in the Hydrology group in the Layer Panel . Objectives Understand the value of DEM datasets to extract a surface water runoff model. Explore the use of hydrological analyses for lava flow hazard assessment. Understand the benefits and limitations of this approach. Theory Flow accumulation Start by showing only the Flow Accumulation (log) layer in QGIS . Conceptually, the Flow Accumulation raster represents the cumulative number of upstream pixels that contribute to surface water drainage to any given downstream pixel . Starting from a DEM, the algorithm: Assumes that water at a given pixel will flow towards the adjacent pixel that shows the greatest \\(-\\Delta z\\) to estimate the flow directions. Once flow direction is estimated, the algorithm counts how many upstream pixels contribute to any given downstream pixel. Question 1: Do it yourself! Starting from this DEM, can you estimate the most likely flow direction and the flow accumulation values? Flow accumulation Pink lines show flow direction . The blue gradient shows flow accumulation \u2192 darker shades of blue indicate the contribution from more pixels . Look at the Flow Accumulation (log) layer in QGIS . For a better visual rendering, this layer shows the log10 of the number of contributing pixels. Analyse the dataset in perspective of the underlying DEM. Does it make sense? (Spoiler alert: it does!) Stream network Now turn on the Stream network layer in QGIS . Stream network algorithm simply applies a threshold of count values \\(c\\) to the Flow Accumulation raster to delineate a stream . If a given pixel has a number of contributing pixels \\(C\\) such as \\(C \\geq c\\) , then the pixel is assumed to be part of the stream. Think of the Stream network information as a higher-level version of the Flow Accumulation raster. As a matter of fact, Stream network is another word for path of steepest descent . Stream network From the same DEM as before, this is how the path of steepest descent would look: Threshold value Note that there is no universal value for \\(c\\) : it depends on such aspects as the maturity of the drainage system, the scale of the analysis or the resolution of the DEM. It should therefore be explored on a case-per-case basis. Drainage basin Turn on the Drainage basin layer in QGIS : this raster now classifies which stream each pixel contributes to . Think of it as a watershed , where ridges act as limits between zone contributing to different streams and valleys accumulate most of the surface flow. Validate that by observing the Drainage basin layer in perspective of the underlying topography. Drainage basin It is now possible to estimate where water on each pixel will go. Question 2: Drainage system You can observe a large discrepancy in the area and the shape of the various drainage basins. How do they spatially vary over the island? How do they relate to the underlying topography? Exercise Historical lava flows Let's now place this data in the context of a hazard assessment. Start by downloading the geological map of La Palma by Carracedo et al., (2001) and spend some time looking at it. Question 3: Historical lava flows Can you spot where historical lava flows occurred? Are they originating from a single or multiple vents? In historical times, what part of the island has been most affected by lava flows? How do the directions of past flow match predictions from hydrological modeling? Monogenetic vs polygenetic volcanism La Palma is a composite volcano. As you can see both from the DEM and the geological map, the currently most active southern part contains several monogenetic vents. Monogenetic vents are typically active during a single eruptive event and not reactivated afterwards. The opening of a new vent is then controlled by several parameters (e.g., tectonic regime 1 ), and predicting the spatial likelihood of vent opening is an additional complexity for long-term hazard and risk assessments in monogenetic fields. This is especially the case for Auckland, which is built on a monogenetic field 2 . Here are some definitions of volcanic landforms 3 : Composite volcanoes All conical or broadly conical polygenetic volcanoes constructed of accumulations of lava and pyroclastic deposits, sometimes alternating, erupted from vent(s) located at the summit (eruptions can also on occasion occur from the flanks) of the volcano. Monogenetic vents Discrete minor volcanic landform that forms during one eruptive cycle. Can be mafic (cinder or scoria cones, maars, diatremes, tuff cones, tuff rings, and scutulum shields) or silicic (lava domes and coule es) in composition. Typical lifetimes of years to decades for mafic centers, decades to centuries for silicic ones. Polygenetic vents Large discrete volcanic landform that forms during several episodic eruptive cycles. Typical lifetimes of \\(10^4-10^5\\) years. Can be mafic or silicic in composition. Most common types are composite volcanoes and shield volcanoes. Probability of vent opening As we will discuss throughout the exercices, assessing where the next monogenetic vent will open is a difficult process. In their paper, Marrero et al. (2019) 4 , used a random model to represent the complexity of the spatial distribution of vent location that the monogenetic volcanic activity can produce. The resulting vents are shown in Figure 1. This is a discussable choice, and you are invited to refer to the original paper for their motivations. In any case, one assumption behind this approach is that all vents shown in Figure 1 have an equal probability of occurrence . Figure 1: Possible location of vent opening for the next eruption according to Marrero et al. (2019). Question 4: Vent opening If all vents in Figure 1 have an equal probability of occurrence , does that mean that the entire island is uniformly exposed to lava flow inundation? What parts of the island are most exposed to lava flow inundation? Are there any safe/shadow parts? The 2021 eruption The 2021 eruption of Cumbre Vieja started on September 19 and lasted until December. During this period, multiple vents opened, some producing tephra whilst other produced compound lava flows that reached the sea. In QGIS , the 2021 Eruption layer group shows you both the vents and the chronology of lava flows provided by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS). Identify feature tool By using the Identify Feature tool in the Toolbar , you can click on any lava flow outline and see its properties in the Identify results panel. Check the date field. Using the lava flow outlines, we computed the evolution of flow length and flow width through time as shown in Figure 2. Question 5: Evolution of the flow field Using the flow outlines in QGIS and Figure 2, estimate: How accurate would have been the steepest descent approach to forecast flow inundation of the 2021 eruption? How different is the actual flow compared to the drainage network? How dynamic is a months-long lava flow? Is it a single event or a compound pulsatory phenomena? What event do you think corresponds to the dashed red line in Figure 2? What happens before and after ? What are the advance and widening rates of the 2021 lava flow? Can you use it to estimate the advance and widening of possible lava flows from other vents? Figure 2: Advance and widening rates of the 2021 lava flow. Food for thoughts Comparing the path of steepest descent approach computed on the pre-2021 eruption topography with the actual outlines of the lava flows of the 2021 eruption shows how: The path of steepest descent captures the general trend of flow direction but The actual flow significantly diverted from this initial prediction. Question 6: Limitations Spend some time thinking about the reasons behind this discrepancy, including: The rheological properties of the lava flows. Their duration, the properties of single vs compound lava flows and their evolution in time. Their relation with topography. From a crisis management perspective and reflecting back on the K\u012blauea crises , the path of steepest descent is a great communication tool for as long as: There is an active monitoring of the crisis as it evolves. There is a clear and trusting communication channel between the monitoring agencies and the stakeholders, thanks to which limitations and uncertainties associated with predictions can be clearly explained and discussed. However, its deterministic nature prevents its ability to systematically account for uncertainties. In a way, it only shows the most likely scenario rather than exploring a range of possible scenarios. Therefore, the path of steepest descent approach is not suited for long-term hazard and risk studies, which are required for such tasks as land-use planning and the pro-active development of other risk-reduction strategies. In the next exercise, we will use a stochastic model to address some of these shortcomings and test it on La Palma. Summary In this exercise, we: Used hydrological modeling tools to obtain a first-order estimate of the possible extent of lava flow inundation. Compared this approach with historical and recent lava flows at La Palma. Discussed its limitations and its domain of applicability.

We will never be able to predict exactly what will happen in the future, so we need to use a modeling framework that allows for uncertainty quantifications. This is where probabilistic modeling enters the show. Probabilistic modeling allows exploring a range of possible future outcomes rather than a a unique realisation. Objectives Introduction to probabilistic hazard modeling Application of a frequentist approach to lava flow inundation Probabilistic modelling Let's go back to the fictional DEM used in the previous exercise . As we saw from existing literature , monogenetic field such as the recent activity at La Palma imply that future eruptive event will take place from a new vent. Imagine that all the red pixels in Figure 1 represent coordinates where the next vent can potentially open. How do we account for the uncertainty associated with vent location when quantifying the hazard of a future eruption? Figure 1: Fictional DEM with locations of possible future vent opening indicated in red. The idea here is that we will not model only one realisation of an event - here one lava flow originating from a single location - but many , and that we will average all their contributions. Unlike what we saw when using the path of steepest descent , we will assess the flow trajectory initiating from all pixels in Figure 1. Figure 2: Combination of the paths of steepest descent estimated from all pixels of Figure 1. Figure 2 shows the overlay of the path of steepest descent computed from each of the 6 pixels identified in Figure 1. What do we see? Some pixels in Figure 2 are inundated regardless of the initialisation point (\u2192 darker shades of pink). Conversely, other pixels are inundated only for selected inundation points (\u2192 lighter shades of pink). Therefore, darker pixels have higher probabilities of inundation than others. Using a frequentist approach, we can calculate the probability \\(P(x,y)\\) of a pixel to be inundated by counting how many times a pixel is hit and normalising this count by the total number of runs, where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the pixel's coordinates: \\[ P(x,y) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{r}}n_{i}}{N_{r}} \\] Where \\(N_{r}\\) is the total number of runs and \\(n_{i}\\) is defined as: \\[ n_{i} = \\bigg\\{ ^{1,\\ if\\ inundation} _{0,\\ otherwise} \\] Figure 3: Computing the probability of inundation using a frequentist approach. So, from Figures 2 and 3: A pixel hit once ( \\(n_{i} = 1\\) ) over the six simulations ( \\(N_{r} = 6\\) ) has a probability \\(P(x,y) = \\frac{1}{6} = 0.17\\) (or 17%).

How do we account for the uncertainty associated with vent location when quantifying the hazard of a future eruption?

Objectives Understand the concepts of probabilistic eruption scenarios . Review the concepts of deterministic , scenario-based probabilistic and probabilistic volcanic hazard assessments. Probabilistic hazard modelling For the sake of this exercise, let's consider a Plinian eruption from Cotopaxi volcano (Ecuador) that occurred ~1200 years ago. By using the workflow previously introduced, we were able to reconstruct the ESP of the eruption 1 . Deposit Maps Eruption classification Figure 1: Isopach ( a , contours of equal thickness) and isopleth ( b , contours of equal largest clasts) for the selected deposit of Cotopaxi volcano. Both maps are in \\(cm\\) . Figure 2: Eruption classification using deposit properties using the methods of a Bonadonna and Costa (2013) and b Pyle (1989). Based on this, we were able to estimate that 4.5 \\(\\times 10^8\\ m^3\\) of tephra were erupted from a 25 km-high plume over ~1h, and that the deposit indeed shows the characteristics of a Plinian eruption 2 3 . Based on the volume, this eruption had a VEI of 4. Great. We now have one reference eruption. But is that sufficient to be used as a representative hazard information for a future eruption of Cotopaxi volcano? The early days: deposit-based hazard maps For a long time, reference eruptions have been used as representative of the most likely future behaviour, in which case an isopach map such as Figure 1 was used as the hazard map for tephra accumulation. What do you think is missing?? Do you think that this approach represents a comprehensive representation of the possible hazard from future eruptions? Why, or why not? What do you think is missing? Missing component #1 The Global Volcanism Program of the Smithsonian Institution is a useful database that attempts to compile the eruptive histories of volcanoes that have been active during the Holocene . Let's have a look at the eruptive history of Cotopaxi volcano inferred this database: What do we see? 78 eruptions are recorded in the catalogue. VEI vary between 1 and 5, which mean that during its history, eruptions at Cotopaxi volcano have had: Plume heights varying between 10's of meters to 10's of km. Erupted volumes varying between 10 \\(^{-5}\\) to 10 \\(^{1}\\) km \\(^{3}\\) . Lesson #1 Using a single isopach map implies that we are considering one realisation of the scope of eruptive behaviour that a given volcanic system is capable of exhibiting. Missing component #2 The tephra fallout hazard extends in the direction of the dominant wind patterns, which vary in time and space . Let's look at statistics of wind velocity and direction over the past 15 years at a given volcano: What do we see? Between the dry and the rainy seasons, the wind direction at this specific volcano can shift by 180 degrees . The rainy season is characterised by lower wind velocities. Lesson #2 Using a single isopach map implies that we are considering one realisation of the possible atmospheric patterns in which a future eruption could occur. As a summary, the previous lesson has provided us with a methodology to predict tephra accumulation , but we need to be able to account for the inherent variability of ESP when quantifying the associated hazard. Probabilistic eruption scenarios Probabilistic hazard modelling for tephra fallout follows the same general philosophy compared to what we adopted for lava flows with two notable differences. Model input \u2192 For lava flows , we used a non-physical model . As a consequence, we explored the uncertainty associated with vent location and the DEM rather than physical properties - or, in other words, ESP . Input parameters to Tephra2 are, however, physical ESP , and the aim of the probabilistic modelling approach for the tephra hazard will be to explore a range of possible eruption conditions for a future event. Model output \u2192 For lava flows , the output of one single run consisted of a boolean inundation/no inundation condition, and the probabilistic approach quantified a likelihood of pixel inundation by a lava flow. Conversely, the output of a single Tephra2 run is a hazard intensity , namely a mass accumulation per surface area ( \\(kg/m^2\\) ). The probabilistic approach will therefore help us to quantify a likelihood of a mass at a given pixel to exceed a specific threshold of mass accumulation . This flowchart illustrates the differences between these approaches: flowchart LR subgraph B[Deterministic tephra modeling] direction LR B1[Tephra2] --> B2[Mass accumulation M at pixel x,y] end subgraph A[Deterministic lava flow modeling] direction LR A1[Lava Flow model] --> A2[Yes/No inundation at pixel x,y] end A --> A0[[Probabilistic]]--> A3[\"P(inundation at pixel x,y)\"] B --> B0[[Probabilistic]]--> B3[\"P(mass at pixel x,y \u2265 threshold)\"] Identify ESP ranges The first step for the probabilistic hazard assessment of tephra fallout is to define an eruption scenario . An eruption scenario represents what we expect to be a possible future eruption behaviour based on our knowledge of the volcanic system. Concretely, an eruption scenario is defined by a spectrum of possible values that each ESP could exhibit during a future eruption. Probabilistic modeling requires to define ESPs not as single but as distributions of values, generally defined as: A range of values (i.e., the minimum and maximum values to explore). A shape of distribution. Let's go back to the Cotopaxi eruption presented above. The plume height estimated from the study of the deposit is 25 km . Based on our knowledge , we might postulate that a plume height of 25 km is indeed likely for a future eruption but want to acknowledge that our level of uncertainty may allow the plume height to vary between 20-30 km. In this case, we might adopt a normal distribution as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3: Starting from a deterministic (i.e., reference eruption) approach (left), an eruption scenario is defined by i) identifying a range (center) and a distribution (right) for each ESP. We need to repeat this process for all ESP relevant for the model used. For Tephra2 , we will focus here on Plume height and mass/volume . The how and why of eruption scenarios There is no magic answer on how to define eruption scenarios. This depends on a case-per-case basis and is often constrained by such aspects as the knowledge of the volcanic system and/or the purpose of the hazard analysis. Definition Ranges of ESP of a given eruption scenario can be tailored to reflect: A VEI An eruptive style An intensity A reference eruption Purpose The way an eruption scenario is defined can also reflect the purpose of the study. For instance, a long-term hazard study designed for preparedness might rely on eruption scenarios that consider wide ranges of EPS and focuses on epistemic uncertainties. Conversely, a hazard assessment required for emergency management during a crises might be informed by monitoring, and the associated scenario might be defined by narrower ranges of ESP that dominantly focus on the aleatory error. A note on the uncertainty of ESPs Choosing the most appropriate range and distribution for each ESP is not trivial and express the uncertainty that we have of what the next eruption will be. We have briefly discussed this at the end of this module , but let's review again what uncertainties are and where they are originating from. Conceptually, uncertainties can be classified in two categories: Uncertainties Epistemic uncertainty derives from the lack of knowledge regarding a phenomena. In theory, we could reduce epistemic uncertainties if more observations of the phenomena were available to help us better constrain the underlying processes and behaviours. Aleatoric uncertainty is associated with the inherent randomness of natural processes. Nothing much we can do about it, really! Figure 4 illustrates four different distributions that have been used in the literature to express ESP variability. These distributions combine both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. Although a better characterisation of the epistemic uncertainty would help to refine the top left distribution towards a distribution centered on a best guess values, the constant presence of an aleatoric component of uncertainty is the reason why the bottom right distribution is impossible to achieve. Probability distributions for ESP Figure 4: Illustration of various probability distributions used for EPS sampling The top left example is a uniform distribution: In this case, any value between min and max has an equal probability of occurrence . This is often referred to as a maximum level of ignorance . The top right example is a normal distribution: Here we assume that a central value has the highest probability of occurrence, but it can divert from it in a symmetrical fashion. The bottom left example is a logarithmic distribution: In this case, we assume that smaller values have higher probabilities of occurrence than larger ones. For instance, large earthquakes occur more often than small ones. Finally, the bottom right example represent an unrealistic case where min = max . This would only occur if there was no uncertainty . The critical objective here is to attempt to translate our knowledge of the volcanic system into realistic eruption scenarios . But how do we improve our knowledge and therefore reduce epistemic uncertainties around ESPs? Pragmatically, there are three main directions to do so: Field studies \u2192 Ideally, identifying the range of ESPs is based on extensive field studies . By reconstructing the stratigraphy of a volcanic edifice, we can study its past eruptive history , which is then used to estimate the potential future eruption scenarios . Literature review \u2192 This personal knowledge is then usually complemented by published literature . Analogues \u2192 However, for volcanoes with a poor geological record, it is often necessary to extend our knowledge based on analogue volcanoes or eruptions. Despite the development of dedicated methodologies 4 , this largely remains a subjective process. This step often relies on global eruption databases such as GVP 5 or LaMEVE 6 . Eruption scenario for Cotopaxi volcano Let's go back to the Cotopaxi case and develop an eruption scenario based around this reference eruption. Based on the eruption from Cotopaxi, we defined a VEI -based eruption scenario assuming: Volume/mass constraints based on a VEI 4 eruption \u2192 0.1\u20131 \\(km^3\\) or 0.1\u20131 \\(\\times 10^{12}\\ kg\\) . Plume heights of 20\u201330 \\(km\\) . Wind conditions based on Reanalysis datasets. Note that for 1 and 2 , we adopt a normal distribution. In this way, we consider that the values obtained from the deposit characterisation are the most likely, but that diverging values also have non-null probabilities of occurrence (albeit less likely). Reanalysis datasets Reanalysis datasets are incredibly useful datasets providing gridded atmospheric conditions at consistent spatial and temporal resolutions for the past 5-7 decades. Initially developed to constrain the initial conditions for weather forecasts, we used them in probabilistic tephra modeling to estimate the most likely wind conditions at a given volcano. We typically download 10-20 years of wind, and these datasets provide one wind profile per either 1, 6, 12 or 24 hours. We rely on two main Reanalysis datasets: ERA5 from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the NCEP-DOE Reanalysis 2 . Probabilistic hazard modelling Now that we have defined the eruption scenario and associated ESPs, let's actually run the probabilistic hazard modeling. Similarly to the approach used for lava flows , we will perform a large number of single model runs. But instead of varying the vent location , each run be initiated with one set of ESP stochastically sampled from the pre-defined distributions. The cartoon below illustrates the process. We modeled \\(n\\) runs: here \\(n=3\\) , but we would typically used thousands of runs to ensure that ESP drawn from each distribution represents a statistically significant sample of the range of possible combinations and outcomes. Run 1 Run 2 Run n Computing hazard probabilities Let's compute probabilities for the following points: P1 , P2 and P3 . Across the 3 runs, P1 had accumulations of 0 \\(kg/m^2\\) for the first two simulations and 5 \\(kg/m^2\\) for the third one. P2 resulted in accumulations of 15, 12 and 2 \\(kg/m^2\\) over runs 1,2 and 3, respectively. P3 had accumulations of 7, 5 and 0 \\(kg/m^2\\) for runs 1,2 and 3, respectively. Let's now consider two tephra accumulation thresholds of 1 and 10 \\(kg/m^2\\) . We want to express how likely these accumulations are to occur over our set of runs. Let's take two examples: Across the 3 runs, an accumulation of 1 \\(kg/m^2\\) at P1 occurred in 1/3 cases: a future tephra accumulations at P1 therefore has a 33% probability to exceed a threshold of of 1 \\(kg/m^2\\) . At P2 , an accumulation of 10 \\(kg/m^2\\) occurred in 2/3 cases: a tephra accumulation of 10 \\(kg/m^2\\) therefore has a 66% probability of occurrence. By repeating this approach over all points of the map, it is now possible to represent the spatial distribution of hazard. What probabilities? Again, pay attention to what these probabilities express : In the case of lava flows , one single model run estimates a boolean yes/no inundation for each pixel, and the probabilistic approach quantifies a probability of flow inundation (\u2192 one single map). In the case of tephra deposits, one single model run estimates a continuous hazard intensity (i.e., mass of tephra per unit area). The probabilistic approach quantifies a probability of accumulation to exceed specific masses per unit area. Therefore, the output for probabilistic hazard assessment for tephra accumulation consists of multiple maps (\u2192 one map per accumulation threshold). Formalising probability computation We have defined an eruption scenario \\(E\\) , and we now want to compute the probability \\(P\\) of a given geographic point \\(x,y\\) to be subject to mass accumulations \\(M\\) exceeding a given accumulation threshold \\(M_T\\) : \\[ P[M(x,y) \\geqslant M_T \\mid E] \\] This probability \\(P\\) is computed using a simple frequentist approach: We simply divide the number of simulations that resulted in an accumulation exceeding the considered threshold (\u2192 \\(M(x,y) \\geqslant M_T\\) ) by the total number of runs: \\[ P(x,y) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{r}}n_{i}}{N_{r}} \\] Where \\(N_{r}\\) is the total number of runs and \\(n_{i}\\) is defined as: \\[ n_{i} = \\bigg\\{ ^{1, if M(x,y) \\geqslant threshold \\mid run} _{0, otherwise} \\] Conditional probabilities The equations above highlight that the probability \\(P\\) is conditional to the occurrence of the eruption scenario . For now, we are only considering this question: What is the probability of a given geographic point to suffer tephra accumulations exceeding \\(x\\ kg/m^2\\) given that the eruption scenario E is occurring . Bear that in mind. We'll get back to this later. Hazard outputs We now have a framework to quantify hazard occurrence probabilistically, but how do we turn this information into a useful knowledge ? Let's look at the different methods available to display probabilistic hazard analyses. For tephra fallout, we have 4 quantities to represent that are: Latitude and longitude . Tephra accumulation . Probability of occurrence . However, it is difficult to represent more than 3 quantities on such a 2D canvas as a map, and we therefore need to fix one quantity , which provides us with 3 different approaches to express hazard. Method 1: Probabilistic hazard maps \u2192 Fixed threshold of tephra accumulation . \u2192 Other quantities are expressed continuously. \u2192 Display the spatial distribution of exceedence probabilities of a single threshold of tephra accumulation (i.e., there are as many maps as accumulation thresholds). Method 2: Probabilistic isomass maps \u2192 Fixed threshold of exceedence probability . \u2192 Other quantities are expressed continuously. \u2192 Display the spatial distribution of tephra accumulation for a single exceedence probability value (i.e., there are as many maps as probability values). Method 3: Hazard curves \u2192 Fixed latitude and longitude. \u2192 Other quantities are expressed continuously. \u2192 Display the probability of occurrence of a given tephra accumulation for a single location (i.e., there are as many curves as points of interest). Is the difference between probability and isomass maps are? Lets look at these sketches: Graphically... More formally... On the left, probabilistic hazard maps quantify the probability to exceed a mass accumulation. Contours show equal probabilities . On the right, probabilistic isomass maps show the mass accumulation occurring for a given probability. Contours show equal accumulations . Therefore, both maps show the same information but emphasise different quantities. Probabilistic hazard modelling estimates the tephra accumulations at a given pixel \\(x,y\\) for all of the \\(n\\) runs (here, \\(n=5\\) ). To produce probabilistic hazard maps , we adopt the frequentist approach previously described and calculate the probability to exceed a given mass accumulation \u2192 e.g., this pixel has a 3/5 = 60% probability of exceeding a tephra accumulation of 10 \\(kg/m^2\\) . To produce probabilistic isomass maps , we estimate the inverse of an empirical cumulative density function using all modelled accumulations \u2192 e.g., the accumulation associated with a 25% exceedence probability is 36 \\(kg/m^2\\) . Rule of thumb Bear in mind: large tephra accumulations usually have lower probabilities of occurrence than smaller accumulations. Example Let's change volcanoes and continents: The examples below illustrate a hazard assessment for a VEI 4 Plinian eruption at Sakurajima volcano 7 in Japan, developed around the 1914 Taisho eruption 8 . Note that the hazard modeling procedure was exactly the same as for Cotopaxi. Probability maps Isomass maps Hazard curves These maps show the spatial probability to exceed accumulations of 1 (left) and 100 (right) \\(kg/m^2\\) . The top and bottom maps illustrate the impact of wind variability on the computed dispersal as a function of the season. The general dispersal is towards the E, but the summer shows a higher variability in directions and lower wind velocities, increasing the hazard on the city of Kagoshima (point number 3). These maps show the typical tephra accumulations for probabilities of occurrences of 25% (left) and 75% (right). Compared to probability maps, we can use the famous saying used in SE Asia: Same same, but different . This plot shows hazard curves computed for three different locations (see the maps for reference): Tarumizu City Hall Kagoshima airport Tarumizu central station Curves show a continuous relationship between tephra accumulation and their respective probabilities of occurrences. The advantage of hazard curves is that they can represent more than a single eruption scenario , which helps comparison. For instance, these plots contain the modelling of the VEI 4 eruption scenario using wind profiles for i) all seasons combined (solid line), the summer (dashed line) and spring, fall and winter (dotted line). To read these plots, start by identifying one tephra accumulation for which you want to estimate the associated probability of occurrence. From the plot's x axis, go straight up until the intersection with the curve representing the scenario of interest. From the point of intersection, go straight left and read the probability value on the y axis. For instance, the Tarumizu City Hall has a ~8% probability of exceeding accumulations of 100 \\(kg/m^2\\) following a VEI 4 eruption of Sakurajima volcano.

As a summary, the previous lesson has provided us with a methodology to predict tephra accumulation , but we need to be able to account for the inherent variability of ESP when quantifying the associated hazard.","title":"The early days: deposit-based hazard maps"},{"location":"Hazard_probabilistic2/#probabilistic-eruption-scenarios","text":"Probabilistic hazard modelling for tephra fallout follows the same general philosophy compared to what we adopted for lava flows with two notable differences. Model input \u2192 For lava flows , we used a non-physical model . As a consequence, we explored the uncertainty associated with vent location and the DEM rather than physical properties - or, in other words, ESP . Input parameters to Tephra2 are, however, physical ESP , and the aim of the probabilistic modelling approach for the tephra hazard will be to explore a range of possible eruption conditions for a future event. Model output \u2192 For lava flows , the output of one single run consisted of a boolean inundation/no inundation condition, and the probabilistic approach quantified a likelihood of pixel inundation by a lava flow. Conversely, the output of a single Tephra2 run is a hazard intensity , namely a mass accumulation per surface area ( \\(kg/m^2\\) ). The probabilistic approach will therefore help us to quantify a likelihood of a mass at a given pixel to exceed a specific threshold of mass accumulation .

An eruption scenario represents what we expect to be a possible future eruption behaviour based on our knowledge of the volcanic system. Concretely, an eruption scenario is defined by a spectrum of possible values that each ESP could exhibit during a future eruption. Probabilistic modeling requires to define ESPs not as single but as distributions of values, generally defined as: A range of values (i.e., the minimum and maximum values to explore). A shape of distribution. Let's go back to the Cotopaxi eruption presented above. The plume height estimated from the study of the deposit is 25 km . Based on our knowledge , we might postulate that a plume height of 25 km is indeed likely for a future eruption but want to acknowledge that our level of uncertainty may allow the plume height to vary between 20-30 km. In this case, we might adopt a normal distribution as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3: Starting from a deterministic (i.e., reference eruption) approach (left), an eruption scenario is defined by i) identifying a range (center) and a distribution (right) for each ESP. We need to repeat this process for all ESP relevant for the model used. For Tephra2 , we will focus here on Plume height and mass/volume . The how and why of eruption scenarios There is no magic answer on how to define eruption scenarios. This depends on a case-per-case basis and is often constrained by such aspects as the knowledge of the volcanic system and/or the purpose of the hazard analysis. Definition Ranges of ESP of a given eruption scenario can be tailored to reflect: A VEI An eruptive style An intensity A reference eruption Purpose The way an eruption scenario is defined can also reflect the purpose of the study. For instance, a long-term hazard study designed for preparedness might rely on eruption scenarios that consider wide ranges of EPS and focuses on epistemic uncertainties. Conversely, a hazard assessment required for emergency management during a crises might be informed by monitoring, and the associated scenario might be defined by narrower ranges of ESP that dominantly focus on the aleatory error.","title":"Identify ESP ranges"},{"location":"Hazard_probabilistic2/#a-note-on-the-uncertainty-of-esps","text":"Choosing the most appropriate range and distribution for each ESP is not trivial and express the uncertainty that we have of what the next eruption will be. We have briefly discussed this at the end of this module , but let's review again what uncertainties are and where they are originating from. Conceptually, uncertainties can be classified in two categories: Uncertainties Epistemic uncertainty derives from the lack of knowledge regarding a phenomena. In theory, we could reduce epistemic uncertainties if more observations of the phenomena were available to help us better constrain the underlying processes and behaviours. Aleatoric uncertainty is associated with the inherent randomness of natural processes. Nothing much we can do about it, really! Figure 4 illustrates four different distributions that have been used in the literature to express ESP variability. These distributions combine both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. Although a better characterisation of the epistemic uncertainty would help to refine the top left distribution towards a distribution centered on a best guess values, the constant presence of an aleatoric component of uncertainty is the reason why the bottom right distribution is impossible to achieve. Probability distributions for ESP Figure 4: Illustration of various probability distributions used for EPS sampling The top left example is a uniform distribution: In this case, any value between min and max has an equal probability of occurrence . This is often referred to as a maximum level of ignorance . The top right example is a normal distribution: Here we assume that a central value has the highest probability of occurrence, but it can divert from it in a symmetrical fashion. The bottom left example is a logarithmic distribution: In this case, we assume that smaller values have higher probabilities of occurrence than larger ones. For instance, large earthquakes occur more often than small ones. Finally, the bottom right example represent an unrealistic case where min = max . This would only occur if there was no uncertainty . The critical objective here is to attempt to translate our knowledge of the volcanic system into realistic eruption scenarios . But how do we improve our knowledge and therefore reduce epistemic uncertainties around ESPs? Pragmatically, there are three main directions to do so: Field studies \u2192 Ideally, identifying the range of ESPs is based on extensive field studies . By reconstructing the stratigraphy of a volcanic edifice, we can study its past eruptive history , which is then used to estimate the potential future eruption scenarios . Literature review \u2192 This personal knowledge is then usually complemented by published literature . Analogues \u2192 However, for volcanoes with a poor geological record, it is often necessary to extend our knowledge based on analogue volcanoes or eruptions. Despite the development of dedicated methodologies 4 , this largely remains a subjective process. This step often relies on global eruption databases such as GVP 5 or LaMEVE 6 .","title":"A note on the uncertainty of ESPs"},{"location":"Hazard_probabilistic2/#eruption-scenario-for-cotopaxi-volcano","text":"Let's go back to the Cotopaxi case and develop an eruption scenario based around this reference eruption.

Initially developed to constrain the initial conditions for weather forecasts, we used them in probabilistic tephra modeling to estimate the most likely wind conditions at a given volcano. We typically download 10-20 years of wind, and these datasets provide one wind profile per either 1, 6, 12 or 24 hours.

Across the 3 runs, P1 had accumulations of 0 \\(kg/m^2\\) for the first two simulations and 5 \\(kg/m^2\\) for the third one. P2 resulted in accumulations of 15, 12 and 2 \\(kg/m^2\\) over runs 1,2 and 3, respectively. P3 had accumulations of 7, 5 and 0 \\(kg/m^2\\) for runs 1,2 and 3, respectively. Let's now consider two tephra accumulation thresholds of 1 and 10 \\(kg/m^2\\) . We want to express how likely these accumulations are to occur over our set of runs. Let's take two examples: Across the 3 runs, an accumulation of 1 \\(kg/m^2\\) at P1 occurred in 1/3 cases: a future tephra accumulations at P1 therefore has a 33% probability to exceed a threshold of of 1 \\(kg/m^2\\) . At P2 , an accumulation of 10 \\(kg/m^2\\) occurred in 2/3 cases: a tephra accumulation of 10 \\(kg/m^2\\) therefore has a 66% probability of occurrence. By repeating this approach over all points of the map, it is now possible to represent the spatial distribution of hazard. What probabilities? Again, pay attention to what these probabilities express : In the case of lava flows , one single model run estimates a boolean yes/no inundation for each pixel, and the probabilistic approach quantifies a probability of flow inundation (\u2192 one single map). In the case of tephra deposits, one single model run estimates a continuous hazard intensity (i.e., mass of tephra per unit area). The probabilistic approach quantifies a probability of accumulation to exceed specific masses per unit area. Therefore, the output for probabilistic hazard assessment for tephra accumulation consists of multiple maps (\u2192 one map per accumulation threshold). Formalising probability computation We have defined an eruption scenario \\(E\\) , and we now want to compute the probability \\(P\\) of a given geographic point \\(x,y\\) to be subject to mass accumulations \\(M\\) exceeding a given accumulation threshold \\(M_T\\) : \\[ P[M(x,y) \\geqslant M_T \\mid E] \\] This probability \\(P\\) is computed using a simple frequentist approach: We simply divide the number of simulations that resulted in an accumulation exceeding the considered threshold (\u2192 \\(M(x,y) \\geqslant M_T\\) ) by the total number of runs: \\[ P(x,y) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{r}}n_{i}}{N_{r}} \\] Where \\(N_{r}\\) is the total number of runs and \\(n_{i}\\) is defined as: \\[ n_{i} = \\bigg\\{ ^{1, if M(x,y) \\geqslant threshold \\mid run} _{0, otherwise} \\] Conditional probabilities The equations above highlight that the probability \\(P\\) is conditional to the occurrence of the eruption scenario .

Let's look at the different methods available to display probabilistic hazard analyses. For tephra fallout, we have 4 quantities to represent that are: Latitude and longitude . Tephra accumulation . Probability of occurrence . However, it is difficult to represent more than 3 quantities on such a 2D canvas as a map, and we therefore need to fix one quantity , which provides us with 3 different approaches to express hazard.

On the left, probabilistic hazard maps quantify the probability to exceed a mass accumulation. Contours show equal probabilities .

To produce probabilistic hazard maps , we adopt the frequentist approach previously described and calculate the probability to exceed a given mass accumulation \u2192 e.g., this pixel has a 3/5 = 60% probability of exceeding a tephra accumulation of 10 \\(kg/m^2\\) . To produce probabilistic isomass maps , we estimate the inverse of an empirical cumulative density function using all modelled accumulations \u2192 e.g., the accumulation associated with a 25% exceedence probability is 36 \\(kg/m^2\\) .

Tephra deposits are widespread deposits generated by explosive volcanic eruption (see Figures 1-5 for examples). The objective of this module explore what is tephra, why are tephra deposits important and how they can impact populations and assets around volcanoes. Later in the module, we will learn how to model the transportation and deposition of tephra, and how to quantify their associated hazards. Objectives The objective of this lessons are to understand: What are tephra deposits. Why they are relevant and what can we learn from them. How they can impact communities. Tephra deposits In the field, tephra deposits generally appear as unconsolidated pyroclastic material that are able to blanket the existing topography. Deposits follow the direction of the dominant wind during the eruptions. As a consequence, a short lasting eruption occurring in a single dominant wind pattern might elongate in a unique direction, whereas long(er)-lasting eruptions can be affected by variable wind profiles and present a less conspicuous unique dispersal direction. With distance from the vent: The thickness of deposits decrease exponentially. Their grain-size distributions become finer . Below are some examples of tephra deposits.

The layering reflects the variability of both eruptive and atmospheric conditions throughout the course of the eruption. In this section, the coarsest material is lapilli and the finest is ash (Picture: S. Biass). Figure 2: Proximal outcrop of the Golden Pumice deposit of K\u012blauea volcano in Hawaii. This deposit is associated with episodes of intense fountaining (Picture: S. Biass). Figure 3: Deposit associated with the 1888-1890 eruption of La Fossa volcano, Italy.

Figure 5: Complex stratigraphy associated with the Oranui eruption of Taup\u014d volcano, New Zealand. This is the largest eruption of the past 70,000 years, with a VEI of 8 (Picture: S. Biass). Size classification of tephra Tephra fragments - or pyroclasts - can be classified in three categories according to their size: Ash \u2013 particles smaller than 2 mm in diameter. Lapilli \u2013 between 2 and 64 mm in diameter. Bombs or blocks \u2013 larger than 64 mm in diameter. Why are tephra deposits important? Tephra deposits are a direct reflection of the eruptive conditions occurring in the plume. By studying , mapping and characterizing these deposits, we can reconstruct the dynamics of eruption and estimate important eruption source parameters ( ESP ). Following the general idea that \"the past is the key to the future\" , this ability is critical to reconstruct the eruptive history of volcanic systems from their stratigraphic record and, in turn, constrain their potential future activity. Field-based methods For recent eruption, direct observation methods can infer ESP in near-real time (e.g., satellite imagery for plume height, infrasound for mass eruption rate ( MER )). However, field-based approaches remain the main approach to extract knowledge from old tephra deposits. Figure 6: Tephra deposits (right) are a direct consequence of the plume dynamics. On the left, the plume associated with the 2015 eruption of Calbuco, Chile (Picture: AFP). On the right, a tephra deposit associated with a Plinian eruption of Cotopaxi volcano, Ecuador (Picture: S. Biass). Volcanic explosivity index The Volcanic explosivity index 2 - or VEI - is a \"measure\" of eruption size based on the volume of tephra produced during an eruption. Despites its limitations (i.e., it is a stepwise measure and largely aggregates small but frequent eruptive styles into a non-explosive category), it remains the most commonly used metrics. Bear in mind that its primary purpose was communication , and it does a great job at it. For measures that better account for the dynamics of eruption, the combined use of magnitude and intensity 3 might be more appropriate. More information can be found here . Field mapping toolbox These sketches provide an overview of the general process followed to characterize tephra deposits. Outcrop Deposit ESP Workflow As we start the field characterisation of a deposit, we first look for outcrops where a given deposit is complete. At the outcrop level, we will start directly measuring a number of different physical quantities including: The deposit thickness . The diameter of the l argest clast(s) observed at this location. The grain-size distribution. The componentry (e.g., ratio of juvenile vs lithics components, presence of free crystals or oxydised particles). Note that following Steno's laws of superposition , the base of the outcrop is older than the top. Therefore, any variability of these parameters in the vertical section indicates a change in time (either of eruption dynamics or wind conditions). As a sufficient number of outcrops is discovered and mapped, we can start plotting them on a map and contour the spatial extent of these properties. Two maps greatly interest us: Isopach maps contour the deposit thickness , which can be used to compute the deposit volume and associated VEI / magnitude. Isopleth maps contour the largest clast that is observed at a given outcrop, which can be used to estimate the plume height and associated MER and intensity. This process is the foundation of the field characterization of tephra deposits and help quantifying ESP 4 . This workflow summarises the entire field-based characterisation of ESPs from tephra deposits. flowchart LR A3 --> A32[VEI]:::clasf A4 --> A42[Magnitude]:::clasf A1[Thickness]:::field ==> A2[Isopach] ==> A3[Volume]:::esp ==> A4[Mass]:::esp ==> F[Eruption duration]:::esp B1[Largest clast]:::field ==> B2[Isopleth] ==> B3[Plume height]:::esp ==> B4[Mass eruption rate]:::esp ==> F A2 --> A22[\"Thinning\" rate]:::clasf B2 --> B22[\"Fining\" rate]:::clasf C[Bulk deposit density]:::field -.-> A4 D[Wind speed] -.-> B4 B4 --> B42[Intensity]:::clasf classDef field fill:#cbdc3850, stroke:#cbdc38; classDef esp fill:#1f78b450, stroke:#1f78b4; classDef clasf fill:#984ea350, stroke:#984ea3; flowchart LR subgraph Legend [\" \"] l1[Field/outcrop measurement]:::field l2[Eruption source parameter]:::esp l3[Classification parameter]:::clasf end classDef field fill:#cbdc3850, stroke:#cbdc38; classDef esp fill:#1f78b450, stroke:#1f78b4; classDef clasf fill:#984ea350, stroke:#984ea3; What impacts can be caused by tephra? Tephra hazard We will focus here on airborne tephra , considering the fraction that is entrained in the convective plume and advected by the wind and ignoring the hazard associated with pyroclastic density currents (PDC). The impact of tephra can be classified in two broad categories: The atmospheric dispersal can impact the air traffic as demonstrated by the 2010 and 2011 eruptions of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull (Iceland) and Cord\u00f3n Caulle (Chile), respectively. In this case, the main hazard impact metrics ( HIM ) is the atmospheric concentration of fine ash in the atmosphere (usually expressed in \\(mg/m^3\\) ). Since modeling the atmospheric dispersal requires 3D models with high computing costs, we won't consider this aspect here. The ground sedimentation impacts populations and assets at the surface of the Earth, and the main hazard impact metrics are a combination of the mass load of tephra (usually expressed in \\(kg/m^2\\) ) and the grain-size distribution of the deposit. This will be the focus of this exercise. Deposit load vs thickness Measuring the mass load in the field is time consuming, and we are therefore often limited to measuring the outcrop's thickness. For simplicity throughout this exercise, we will consider that mass load and thickness can be interchanged using a bulk density of 1000 \\(kg/m^3\\) . So, for instance: 1 \\(mm\\) = 1 \\(kg/m^3\\) . 1 \\(cm\\) = 10 \\(kg/m^3\\) . 10 \\(cm\\) = 100 \\(kg/m^3\\) . 1 \\(m\\) = 1000 \\(kg/m^3\\) . A spatially-dependent hazard intensity Tephra deposits can extend 10's, 100's to 1000's of km away from the source. With distance from the vent, their thickness decrease exponentially and they gradually get finer. The widespread nature of tephra deposits and the spatial evolution of their associated hazard metrics make the associated impacts and risk difficult to predict 5 . Impacts can be broadly characterised into 3 zones as a function of the distance from the vent 6 : Zone 1 : Destructive and immediately life-threatening. Zone 2 : Damaging and/or disruptive. Zone 3 : Disruptive and/or a nuisance. Figure 7: Schematic of some ash fall impacts with distance from a volcano. This assumes a large explosive eruption with significant ash fall thicknesses in the proximal zone and is intended to be illustrative rather than prescriptive. Adapted from Jenkins et al. (2015). A relative distance The distance acting as a limit between these zones is relative and varies with the eruption style. The deposits of large (e.g. Plinian) eruptions will extend farther away than those of smaller (e.g. Vulcanian) eruptions, and the extent of zones 1-3 will vary accordingly. Vulnerability and risk Since the 70's/80's, a change of paradigm the concept of vulnerability as a cornerstone of volcanic risk 7 . For the purpose of this exercise, let's consider that the risk \\(R\\) can be defined as a function of at least 3 components that are: \\(H\\) - hazard - expressing the spatial (and temporal) distribution of the intensity of a hazardous phenomenon. \\(E\\) - exposure - expressing the presence of exposed populations, assets, goods, natural features, ecosystem services etc. to the hazardous phenomenon. \\(V\\) - vulnerability - expressing how the exposed element will be negatively impacted as a function of the hazard intensity. The most fundamental definition of risk is defined as \\(R = f(H,E,V)\\) . Although this exercise focuses on hazard , a meaningful discussion of hazard outputs usually borrows some concept of vulnerability to illustrate results. In volcanology, several approaches are used to express vulnerability, varying in complexity as a function of the knowledge of the problem 8 : Type Description Threshold Hazard intensity thresholds for onset of a given impact. Weak buildings are typically assume to start collapsing at tephra thicknesses of 100-300 \\(kg/m^2\\) , although this is highly dependent on the building morphology, quality and on the properties of the deposit. Damage/disruption states ( DDS ) Stepwise categorisation of impact as a function of hazard intensity. On example is to assume that pastoral agriculture can suffer production losses <50%, >50%, and total for accumulations of 25, 60 and 100 mm of tephra 8 . Fragility function Mathematical function expressing the probability of a level of impact being equalled or exceeded for a given hazard intensity 8 . See Figure 9 for an example of fragility functions defined for composite European roofs 9 . Vulnerability function Same as the fragility function, but expressing a relative loss or economic cost to hazard intensity. Damage disruption state Fragility function Figure 8: Example of damage/disruption states for ground crops (modified after Jenkins et al. 2015). Figure 9: Example of fragility functions describing the probability of collapse for weak (WE), medium weak (MW), medium strong (MS) and strong (ST) roofs as a function of the tephra load. Other variables considered in risk estimates Throughout the course, we are likely to discuss other actors of risk. Amongst them are: Resilience , which is the opposite of vulnerability and describes the condition that will reduce the negative consequences of a natural hazard. Cost , which is required to express the risk as a monetary value. Food for thoughts The 2015 edition of the Global assessment report ( GAR ) on disaster risk reduction report by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction represents the first inclusion of volcanic risk within the UN risk framework. This testifies of the growing awareness of the potential global impact of future large eruptions on modern societies. Similarly, re-insurance companies are beginning to include volcanic risk in their portfolios and developing new dedicated products through, for instance, parametric risk transfer solutions 10 and CAT bonds . Despites these new efforts, the complexity of the hazard associated with tephra fallout and the full range of potential impacts is often under-appreciated. This shortcoming is rooted in two main causes. On the one hand, eruptions are complex multi-hazard events. Each eruptions style is associated with specific hazards: for instance, the hazards associated with Strombolian eruptions are different than those associated with phreatomagmatic or Plinian events. These hazards evolve in space and time, creating complex vulnerability patterns . On the other hand, volcanic eruptions are less frequent than other natural hazards. As a consequence, and our empirical dataset of observations available to predict future impacts based on past lessons is more limited, which impedes the development of operational impact models. The Global Volcanic Hazards and Risk book, published in 2015 in the context of the GAR report, contains a chapter entitled Volcanic ash fall hazard and risk by Jenkins et al. 6 . This chapter is freely accessible online and offers a review of the impacts and proposes tentative damage/disruption states for key vulnerability aspects. Specifically: Tables 3.2 \u2192 3.5 illustrate the range of impacts as a function of the zones defined above. Tables 3.6 \u2192 3.8 propose damage/disruption states based on a comprehensive review of the literature. This chapter provides the currently most useful and pragmatic compilation of available DDS related to the tephra hazard.

By studying , mapping and characterizing these deposits, we can reconstruct the dynamics of eruption and estimate important eruption source parameters ( ESP ). Following the general idea that \"the past is the key to the future\" , this ability is critical to reconstruct the eruptive history of volcanic systems from their stratigraphic record and, in turn, constrain their potential future activity. Field-based methods For recent eruption, direct observation methods can infer ESP in near-real time (e.g., satellite imagery for plume height, infrasound for mass eruption rate ( MER )). However, field-based approaches remain the main approach to extract knowledge from old tephra deposits. Figure 6: Tephra deposits (right) are a direct consequence of the plume dynamics. On the left, the plume associated with the 2015 eruption of Calbuco, Chile (Picture: AFP). On the right, a tephra deposit associated with a Plinian eruption of Cotopaxi volcano, Ecuador (Picture: S. Biass). Volcanic explosivity index The Volcanic explosivity index 2 - or VEI - is a \"measure\" of eruption size based on the volume of tephra produced during an eruption. Despites its limitations (i.e., it is a stepwise measure and largely aggregates small but frequent eruptive styles into a non-explosive category), it remains the most commonly used metrics. Bear in mind that its primary purpose was communication , and it does a great job at it. For measures that better account for the dynamics of eruption, the combined use of magnitude and intensity 3 might be more appropriate.

Outcrop Deposit ESP Workflow As we start the field characterisation of a deposit, we first look for outcrops where a given deposit is complete. At the outcrop level, we will start directly measuring a number of different physical quantities including: The deposit thickness . The diameter of the l argest clast(s) observed at this location. The grain-size distribution. The componentry (e.g., ratio of juvenile vs lithics components, presence of free crystals or oxydised particles). Note that following Steno's laws of superposition , the base of the outcrop is older than the top. Therefore, any variability of these parameters in the vertical section indicates a change in time (either of eruption dynamics or wind conditions). As a sufficient number of outcrops is discovered and mapped, we can start plotting them on a map and contour the spatial extent of these properties. Two maps greatly interest us: Isopach maps contour the deposit thickness , which can be used to compute the deposit volume and associated VEI / magnitude. Isopleth maps contour the largest clast that is observed at a given outcrop, which can be used to estimate the plume height and associated MER and intensity. This process is the foundation of the field characterization of tephra deposits and help quantifying ESP 4 .

The impact of tephra can be classified in two broad categories: The atmospheric dispersal can impact the air traffic as demonstrated by the 2010 and 2011 eruptions of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull (Iceland) and Cord\u00f3n Caulle (Chile), respectively. In this case, the main hazard impact metrics ( HIM ) is the atmospheric concentration of fine ash in the atmosphere (usually expressed in \\(mg/m^3\\) ). Since modeling the atmospheric dispersal requires 3D models with high computing costs, we won't consider this aspect here. The ground sedimentation impacts populations and assets at the surface of the Earth, and the main hazard impact metrics are a combination of the mass load of tephra (usually expressed in \\(kg/m^2\\) ) and the grain-size distribution of the deposit.

Impacts can be broadly characterised into 3 zones as a function of the distance from the vent 6 : Zone 1 : Destructive and immediately life-threatening. Zone 2 : Damaging and/or disruptive. Zone 3 : Disruptive and/or a nuisance. Figure 7: Schematic of some ash fall impacts with distance from a volcano.

For the purpose of this exercise, let's consider that the risk \\(R\\) can be defined as a function of at least 3 components that are: \\(H\\) - hazard - expressing the spatial (and temporal) distribution of the intensity of a hazardous phenomenon. \\(E\\) - exposure - expressing the presence of exposed populations, assets, goods, natural features, ecosystem services etc. to the hazardous phenomenon. \\(V\\) - vulnerability - expressing how the exposed element will be negatively impacted as a function of the hazard intensity. The most fundamental definition of risk is defined as \\(R = f(H,E,V)\\) . Although this exercise focuses on hazard , a meaningful discussion of hazard outputs usually borrows some concept of vulnerability to illustrate results. In volcanology, several approaches are used to express vulnerability, varying in complexity as a function of the knowledge of the problem 8 : Type Description Threshold Hazard intensity thresholds for onset of a given impact. Weak buildings are typically assume to start collapsing at tephra thicknesses of 100-300 \\(kg/m^2\\) , although this is highly dependent on the building morphology, quality and on the properties of the deposit. Damage/disruption states ( DDS ) Stepwise categorisation of impact as a function of hazard intensity. On example is to assume that pastoral agriculture can suffer production losses <50%, >50%, and total for accumulations of 25, 60 and 100 mm of tephra 8 . Fragility function Mathematical function expressing the probability of a level of impact being equalled or exceeded for a given hazard intensity 8 . See Figure 9 for an example of fragility functions defined for composite European roofs 9 . Vulnerability function Same as the fragility function, but expressing a relative loss or economic cost to hazard intensity.

Other variables considered in risk estimates Throughout the course, we are likely to discuss other actors of risk. Amongst them are: Resilience , which is the opposite of vulnerability and describes the condition that will reduce the negative consequences of a natural hazard. Cost , which is required to express the risk as a monetary value.","title":"Vulnerability and risk"},{"location":"Hazard_tephra_intro/#food-for-thoughts","text":"The 2015 edition of the Global assessment report ( GAR ) on disaster risk reduction report by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction represents the first inclusion of volcanic risk within the UN risk framework. This testifies of the growing awareness of the potential global impact of future large eruptions on modern societies. Similarly, re-insurance companies are beginning to include volcanic risk in their portfolios and developing new dedicated products through, for instance, parametric risk transfer solutions 10 and CAT bonds . Despites these new efforts, the complexity of the hazard associated with tephra fallout and the full range of potential impacts is often under-appreciated. This shortcoming is rooted in two main causes. On the one hand, eruptions are complex multi-hazard events. Each eruptions style is associated with specific hazards: for instance, the hazards associated with Strombolian eruptions are different than those associated with phreatomagmatic or Plinian events. These hazards evolve in space and time, creating complex vulnerability patterns . On the other hand, volcanic eruptions are less frequent than other natural hazards. As a consequence, and our empirical dataset of observations available to predict future impacts based on past lessons is more limited, which impedes the development of operational impact models. The Global Volcanic Hazards and Risk book, published in 2015 in the context of the GAR report, contains a chapter entitled Volcanic ash fall hazard and risk by Jenkins et al. 6 .

Similar models do not exist for tephra dispersal and deposition , and we require physics-based models to assess the related hazard. Objectives Understand the large-scale physical processes controlling tephra dispersal modeling. Review various modeling strategies, their purposes, benefits and limitations. Introduce the concept of eruption source parameters . Modeling tephra dispersal Models are approximation of reality. In the case of natural hazards, a useful model must be able to estimate the spatial and temporal distribution of hazard intensity metrics as a function of initial contitions : flowchart LR A[Initial conditions] --> B[[MODEL]] --> C[Hazard intensity metrics] For instance, a simple flood model might attempt to estimate the inundated area (\u2192 HIM ) as a function of rainfall and the watershed properties (\u2192initial conditions). Models can be classified in two main categories: Physical models rely on a simplified formulation of physical laws. Mathematical models are data-driven and namely include statistical or machine learning-powered models. Q-LavHA falls in this category. This part of the module focuses on the use of a physical model. Model parametrisation A physical model is a parametrisation of natural processes, which means that the physics behind a phenomenon is described by a set of equations that we could theoretically solve with the right input parameters . For instance, accurately describing tephra transport and deposition requires to account for the following aspects: The generation of volcanic particles. The ejection of volcanic pyroclasts in the atmosphere (\u2192 the vertical column ). The dispersal of this material by the wind in the atmosphere (\u2192 the \"mushroom\" horizontal plume ). The sedimentation of particles onto the ground (\u2192 the tephra deposit ). There is no unique way of solving this problem. Depending on the assumptions behind the physical processes and the purpose of the model, the governing equations can be posed in a more or less complex way. This slideshow summarises the various steps that tephra transport and deposition models have to solve: Exsolution Fragmentation Convection Wind advection Tephra sedimentation Volatiles (\u2192 gases) dissolved in the magma starts to escape. As a result, the liquid magma starts rising in the conduit. The liquid accelerates upwards, the rate of deformation becomes critical and the liquid starts behaving like a solid. The magma becomes brittle and fragments: it is now a cloud of solid (\u2192 pyroclasts) particles surrounded by gas. The material reaches the atmosphere with sufficient momentum to entrain surrounding air. The plume becomes lighter than the atmosphere and rises from buoyancy forces. After entraining sufficient air, the plume reaches the same density as the atmosphere (\u2192 level of neutral buoyancy). The umbrella cloud develops and elongates in the direction of the wind. Particles are carried horizontally in the umbrella cloud. As it evolves away from the source, it becomes less \"strong\" and is not able to transport particles. Large particles leave the umbrella cloud first and fall close to the vent, while finer particles are carried farther away, creating the tephra deposit . Strong plumes These cartoons assume a strong plume with a typical mushroom-shaped morphology. However, keep in mind that other types of transitional or weak plumes exist. If the vertical rate of ascent of the plume is not sufficiently high, the plume can collapse and create pyrocalstic density currents . Modeling choices Some models attempt solving all physical processes taking place in time and space. These models are complex and (theoretically) have a higher accuracy. However, their use is often impeded by: The large number of input parameters required to solve all the physics. The high computational time required to run them. Alternatively, other models adopt assumptions that allows them to simplify some physical processes. Although their (again, theoretical) accuracy is lower, these models: Require less input parameters, which facilitates their use. Are faster to run as they do not need to solve as many equations. What model is better for hazard assessment? Is a complex numerical model always better than a simpler model (e.g., empirical or probabilistic)? Well, not necessarily, it all depends on context . When a high accuracy is required, complex numerical models are generally better. However, they usually require a large number of input parameters and an important computing power. Therefore, they are not suited for probabilistic analyses as their computational time is too large, and they are therefore mostly used for deterministic modeling. Conversely, simpler models might not capture all the subtleties of the underlying processes, but are easier to use and require less computation cost. Therefore, they can be used for probabilistic modeling and are often used for long-term hazard assessments. The Tephra2 model In order to assess the hazard associated with tephra accumulation, we will here use the Tephra2 model 1 . Tephra2 uses an analytical solution to the advection-diffusion equation . In other words: Tephra2 simplifies the atmospheric transport of particles, thanks to which the tephra accumulation can be computed rapidly. Numerous of input parameters related to atmospheric transport are parametrised into a few parameters. Computation time is fast. These specificities make Tephra2 highly suited for probabilistic hazard assessment purposes. Other models The design of Tephra2 prevents it to compute atmospheric concentration , for which 3D models are usually required. Such models include Ash3D , which can be used as an online tool after registration, or Fall3D , available here . Eruption source parameters Let's introduce an important concept that we will use throughout the exercise: Eruption source parameter or ESP : Eruption source parameters ESP are the initial conditions required by a given model to describe specific physical processes. ESP are therefore synonyms of initial conditions . Why a different name then? Let's look at the main ESP required by Tephra2 : ESP Description mass Total tephra mass erupted during the eruption, in \\(kg\\) . height Plume height, in \\(km\\) . TGSD Total grain-size distribution ( TGSD ) \u2192 controls the content in coarse vs fine particles, in \\(\\phi\\) units \u2192 \\(=-log_2(diam.\\ [mm])\\) . wind Wind conditions during the eruption, specifically wind direction ( \\(^{\\circ}\\) ) and speed ( \\(m/s\\) ). MER Indirectly used in Tephra2 , the mass eruption rate ( MER ; \\(kg/m^2\\) ) is estimated from height and wind speed . Do you notice anything? \u2192 All these EPS are quantities that can be directly measured in the field! Therefore, we, as Physical volcanologists/Geologists/Earth Scientists, can directly translate geological information into model inputs in the perspective of our knowledge of the underlying processes. Thanks to that, we prevent over-fitting our model (i.e., tuning initial conditions to fit a desired output) or using a black-box approach. Food for thoughts Many different models for tephra dispersal and deposition exist, some of which can be found here , or in the report of the 2021 Ash and Aviation Workshop report . It is again important to chose the appropriate model for a given context . For instance, Tephra2 is suited for probabilistic hazard analyses, but being time-independent, it cannot capture the spatio-temporal evolution of the ash cloud. It is therefore more suited for preparedness rather than crisis management . Conversely, Fall3D 2 is a 3D, time-dependent model that is able to describe the evolution of the ash cloud in 4D. Its computational costs limits its probabilistic applications, but it is suited to monitor the evolution of a crisis in near-real time. As a result, the same remarks as those made for lava flow models hold for tephra hazard assessment: It is important to understand the benefit and limitations of each model in order to choose the most appropriate one. Similarly, various models will require different types of ESP , some of which can be directly estimated from field studies, others that require additional laboratory analyses or plain guessing. Here, we use the Tephra2 model as its main ESPs can be estimated in the field. In the next section, we will look at how to turn ESP into eruption scenarios . Summary This section provided an introduction to the modeling of tephra dispersal and deposition. We reviewed: The main physical volcanology aspects involved in the problem. Various modeling approaches available to solve it. Introduced Tephra2 and its critical ESP . In the next section, we will look at the philosophy behind using Tephra2 for probabilistic hazard modelling.

The ejection of volcanic pyroclasts in the atmosphere (\u2192 the vertical column ). The dispersal of this material by the wind in the atmosphere (\u2192 the \"mushroom\" horizontal plume ). The sedimentation of particles onto the ground (\u2192 the tephra deposit ). There is no unique way of solving this problem. Depending on the assumptions behind the physical processes and the purpose of the model, the governing equations can be posed in a more or less complex way. This slideshow summarises the various steps that tephra transport and deposition models have to solve: Exsolution Fragmentation Convection Wind advection Tephra sedimentation Volatiles (\u2192 gases) dissolved in the magma starts to escape. As a result, the liquid magma starts rising in the conduit. The liquid accelerates upwards, the rate of deformation becomes critical and the liquid starts behaving like a solid. The magma becomes brittle and fragments: it is now a cloud of solid (\u2192 pyroclasts) particles surrounded by gas. The material reaches the atmosphere with sufficient momentum to entrain surrounding air. The plume becomes lighter than the atmosphere and rises from buoyancy forces. After entraining sufficient air, the plume reaches the same density as the atmosphere (\u2192 level of neutral buoyancy). The umbrella cloud develops and elongates in the direction of the wind. Particles are carried horizontally in the umbrella cloud. As it evolves away from the source, it becomes less \"strong\" and is not able to transport particles. Large particles leave the umbrella cloud first and fall close to the vent, while finer particles are carried farther away, creating the tephra deposit . Strong plumes These cartoons assume a strong plume with a typical mushroom-shaped morphology. However, keep in mind that other types of transitional or weak plumes exist. If the vertical rate of ascent of the plume is not sufficiently high, the plume can collapse and create pyrocalstic density currents .","title":"Model parametrisation"},{"location":"Hazard_tephra_modeling/#modeling-choices","text":"Some models attempt solving all physical processes taking place in time and space. These models are complex and (theoretically) have a higher accuracy. However, their use is often impeded by: The large number of input parameters required to solve all the physics. The high computational time required to run them. Alternatively, other models adopt assumptions that allows them to simplify some physical processes. Although their (again, theoretical) accuracy is lower, these models: Require less input parameters, which facilitates their use. Are faster to run as they do not need to solve as many equations. What model is better for hazard assessment? Is a complex numerical model always better than a simpler model (e.g., empirical or probabilistic)? Well, not necessarily, it all depends on context . When a high accuracy is required, complex numerical models are generally better. However, they usually require a large number of input parameters and an important computing power. Therefore, they are not suited for probabilistic analyses as their computational time is too large, and they are therefore mostly used for deterministic modeling. Conversely, simpler models might not capture all the subtleties of the underlying processes, but are easier to use and require less computation cost. Therefore, they can be used for probabilistic modeling and are often used for long-term hazard assessments.","title":"Modeling choices"},{"location":"Hazard_tephra_modeling/#the-tephra2-model","text":"In order to assess the hazard associated with tephra accumulation, we will here use the Tephra2 model 1 . Tephra2 uses an analytical solution to the advection-diffusion equation . In other words: Tephra2 simplifies the atmospheric transport of particles, thanks to which the tephra accumulation can be computed rapidly. Numerous of input parameters related to atmospheric transport are parametrised into a few parameters. Computation time is fast. These specificities make Tephra2 highly suited for probabilistic hazard assessment purposes. Other models The design of Tephra2 prevents it to compute atmospheric concentration , for which 3D models are usually required. Such models include Ash3D , which can be used as an online tool after registration, or Fall3D , available here .","title":"The Tephra2 model"},{"location":"Hazard_tephra_modeling/#eruption-source-parameters","text":"Let's introduce an important concept that we will use throughout the exercise: Eruption source parameter or ESP : Eruption source parameters ESP are the initial conditions required by a given model to describe specific physical processes. ESP are therefore synonyms of initial conditions . Why a different name then? Let's look at the main ESP required by Tephra2 : ESP Description mass Total tephra mass erupted during the eruption, in \\(kg\\) . height Plume height, in \\(km\\) . TGSD Total grain-size distribution ( TGSD ) \u2192 controls the content in coarse vs fine particles, in \\(\\phi\\) units \u2192 \\(=-log_2(diam.\\ [mm])\\) . wind Wind conditions during the eruption, specifically wind direction ( \\(^{\\circ}\\) ) and speed ( \\(m/s\\) ). MER Indirectly used in Tephra2 , the mass eruption rate ( MER ; \\(kg/m^2\\) ) is estimated from height and wind speed . Do you notice anything? \u2192 All these EPS are quantities that can be directly measured in the field! Therefore, we, as Physical volcanologists/Geologists/Earth Scientists, can directly translate geological information into model inputs in the perspective of our knowledge of the underlying processes. Thanks to that, we prevent over-fitting our model (i.e., tuning initial conditions to fit a desired output) or using a black-box approach.","title":"Eruption source parameters"},{"location":"Hazard_tephra_modeling/#food-for-thoughts","text":"Many different models for tephra dispersal and deposition exist, some of which can be found here , or in the report of the 2021 Ash and Aviation Workshop report . It is again important to chose the appropriate model for a given context . For instance, Tephra2 is suited for probabilistic hazard analyses, but being time-independent, it cannot capture the spatio-temporal evolution of the ash cloud. It is therefore more suited for preparedness rather than crisis management . Conversely, Fall3D 2 is a 3D, time-dependent model that is able to describe the evolution of the ash cloud in 4D. Its computational costs limits its probabilistic applications, but it is suited to monitor the evolution of a crisis in near-real time. As a result, the same remarks as those made for lava flow models hold for tephra hazard assessment: It is important to understand the benefit and limitations of each model in order to choose the most appropriate one. Similarly, various models will require different types of ESP , some of which can be directly estimated from field studies, others that require additional laboratory analyses or plain guessing. Here, we use the Tephra2 model as its main ESPs can be estimated in the field. In the next section, we will look at how to turn ESP into eruption scenarios .","title":" Food for thoughts"},{"location":"Hazard_tephra_modeling/#summary","text":"This section provided an introduction to the modeling of tephra dispersal and deposition.

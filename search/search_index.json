Over the past years, volcanic crises in Hawaii in 2018, in DRC and La Palma in 2021 have demonstrated the difficulty in managing these long\u2013lasting crises. This is due to the fact that lava flows are governed by complex rheological processes, which makes them hard to predict. As a result, forecasts are often associated with large uncertainties that makes them unusable during crisis management. Does this mean that we are helpless in reducing the risk associated with lava flows? Well, no, the idea here is to plan ahead of an eruption, but we will discuss that throughout the exercises. Case-study: La Palma Exercise outline In this exercise, we will look at two complementary approaches to assess the hazard associated with lava flow inundation that are the path of steepest descent and the Q-LavHA model. Path of steepest descent Firstly, we will have a look at how simple hydrological tools can help us estimate the direction of lava flows. The path of steepest descent approach, which estimates flow direction based on the hydrological properties of the terrain. Despites its simplicity, this is the preferred method used by USGS and Hawaii Volcano Observatory (HVO) to communicate with stakeholders during lava flow crises. Q-LavHA Secondly, we will test the Q-LavHA model, which goes one step forward in attempting to predict lava flow inundation using some stochastic sampling to estimate the uncertainty associated with lava flow emplacement processes. Objectives With this exercise, you will: Get familiar with two types of approaches to estimate the hazard associated with lava flow inundation. Compare to deterministic and probabilistic approaches. Understand the value of uncertainty quantification and it's role in risk communication. Appreciate the difference between short-term hazard communication during crises and long-term hazard assessment for risk mitigation. Communicating uncertainties during lava flow crises Since the beginning of the Pu\u2018u\u2018\u014d\u2018\u014d eruption in 1983 to its end in 2018 , the Big Island of Hawaii has been periodically affected by lava flow crises. These repeated crises have provided important lessons on how to communicate hazard uncertainties during crises. During the 2014 crisis, the flow field was dangerously heading towards the town of P\u0101hoa. Under pressure from decision makers, HVO attempted to provide a forecast and estimated that the flow might reach the town of P\u0101hoa within a few to tens of days... only that the media only reported the \"a few\" days, creating panic amongst the community. HVO realised the difficulty in communicating such a large uncertainty in operational activities and decided to cease providing forecasts. Instead, they reverted back to the steepest descent method which, although over-simplifying complex flow-emplacement processes, has the benefit of being transparent. In addition, HVO conducted meetings with stakeholders, agencies and the public, where they explained the limitations encountered when modeling lava flows. This combination of the use of a simplistic model with outreach events proved out to be the most efficient communication procedure and contributed to both increasing the trust in HVO and efficiently reducing the risk 1 2 .

DEM are raster data containing an elevation value at each pixel. Global DEM datasets such as SRTM or ASTER are usually produced from the ISS or satellite imagery, but higher-definition datasets can be produced from airborne LiDAR missions or structure-from-motion from UAVs . Here, we will use a DEM with a resolution of 25 m covering the island of La Palma. Using only a DEM, hydrological analyses can help establishing a surface water system model that we can use to study the hydrological characteristics of surface hydrological processes. Thanks to that, it is possible to estimate such aspects as the most likely flow directions, catchment areas and drainage bassins. It is therefore extensively used in land-use planning to estimate potentially flooding areas or to design proposed drainage systems and facilities. Here, we will use this workflow to get a general idea of the possible lava flow inundation areas in La Palma: flowchart LR A[Flow accumulation] --> B[Stream network] B --> C[Drainage basins] Several softwares propose implementations of hydrological analyses including QGIS , Matlab and ArcGIS . Here, we have pre-computed the important datasets for you, which are contained in the Hydrology group in the Layer Panel . Objectives Understand the value of DEM datasets to extract a surface water runoff model. Explore the use of hydrological analyses for lava flow hazard assessment. Understand the benefits and limitations of this approach. Surface drainage Flow accumulation Start by showing only the Flow Accumulation (log) layer in QGIS . Conceptually, the Flow Accumulation raster represents the cumulative number of upstream pixels that contribute to surface water drainage to any given downstream pixel . Starting from a DEM, the algorithm: Assumes that water at a given pixel will flow towards the adjacent pixel that shows the greatest \\(-\\Delta z\\) to estimate the flow directions. Once flow direction is estimated, the algorithm counts how many upstream pixel contribute to any given downstream pixel. Do it yourself! Starting from this DEM, can you estimate the most likely flow direction and the flow accumulation values? Flow accumulation Pink lines show flow direction . The blue gradient shows flow accumulation \u2192 darker shades of blue indicate the contribution from more pixels . Look at the Flow Accumulation (log) layer in QGIS . Here, we show the log value to have a better visual rendering, so each pixel shows the log10 of the number of contributing pixels. Analyse the dataset in perspective of the underlying DEM. Does it make sense? (Spoiler alert: it does!) Stream network Now turn on the Stream network layer in QGIS . As Flow Accumulation raster are slightly overwhelming, the Stream network algorithm simply applies a threshold of count values \\(c\\) to delineate a stream . If a given pixel has a number of contributing pixels \\(C\\) such as \\(C \\geq c\\) , then the pixel is assumed to be part of the stream. Think of the Stream network information as a higher-level version of the Flow Accumulation raster. As a matter of fact, Stream network is another word for path of steepest descent . Stream network From the same DEM as before, this is how the path of steepest descent would look: Threshold value Note that there is no universal value for \\(c\\) : it depends on such aspects as the characteristics of the drainage system , the scale of the analysis or the resolution of the DEM. It should therefore be explored on a case-per-case basis. Drainage basin Turn on the Drainage basin layer in QGIS : this raster now classifies which stream each pixel contributes to . Think of it as a watershed , where ridges act as limits between zone contributing to different streams and valleys accumulate most of the surface flow. Validate that by observing the Drainage basin layer in perspective of the underlying topography. Drainage basin It is now possible to estimate where water on each pixel will go. Maturity of the drainage system You can observe a large discrepancy in the area and the shape of the various drainage basins. How do they spatially vary over the island? How do they relate to the underlying topography? Things to observe: - Man-made structures can affect the surface runoff \u2192 Airport Hazard assessment Historical lava flows Let's now place this data in the context of a hazard assessment. Start by downloading the geological map of La Palma by Carracedo et al., (2001) and spend some time looking at it. Questions Can you spot where historical lava flows occurred? Are they originating from a single or multiple vents? In historical times, what part of the island has been most affected by lava flows? How do the directions of past flow match the conclusions reached from hydrological modeling? Monogenetic vs polygenetic volcanism La Palma is a composite volcano. As you can see both from the DEM and the geological map, the currently most active southern part contains several monogenetic vents. Monogenetic vents are typically active during a single eruption and not reactivated afterwards. The opening of a new vent is then controlled by several parameters (e.g., tectonic regime 1 ), and predicting the spatial likelihood of vent opening is an additional complexity for long-term hazard and risk assessments in monogenetic fields. This is especially the case for Auckland, which is built on a monogenetic field 2 . Here are some definitions of volcanic landforms from de Silva and Lindsay (2015) 3 : Composite volcanoes All conical or broadly conical polygenetic volcanoes constructed of accumulations of lava and pyroclastic deposits, sometimes alternating, erupted from vent(s) located at the summit (eruptions can also on occasion occur from the flanks) of the volcano. Monogenetic vents Discrete minor volcanic landform that forms during one eruptive cycle. Can be mafic (cinder or scoria cones, maars, diatremes, tuff cones, tuff rings, and scutulum shields) or silicic (lava domes and coule es) in composition. Typical lifetimes of years to decades for mafic centers, decades to centuries for silicic ones. Polygenetic vents Large discrete volcanic landform that forms during several episodic eruptive cycles. Typical lifetimes of \\(10^4-10^5\\) years. Can be mafic or silicic in composition. Most common types are composite volcanoes and shield volcanoes. Probability of vent opening As we will discuss throughout the exercices, assessing where the next monogenetic vent will open is a difficult process. In their 2019 paper, Marrero et al. (2019) 4 , used a random model to represent the complexity of the spatial distribution of vent location that the monogenetic volcanic activity can produce. The resulting vents are shown in Figure 1. This is a discussable choice, and you are invited to refer to the original paper for their motivations. In any case, one assumption behind this approach is that all vents shown in Figure 1 have an equal probability of occurrence . Figure 1: Possible location of vent opening for the next eruption according to Marrero et al. (2019). Questions If all vents in Figure 1 have an equal probability of occurrence , does that mean that the entire island is uniformly exposed to lava flow inundation? Use the drainage basins and the stream networks to estimate: - What parts of the island are most exposed to lava flow inundation? - Are there any safe/shadow parts? The 2021 eruption The 2021 eruption of Cumbre Vieja started on September 19 and lasted until December 25. During this period, multiple vents opened, some producing tephra whilst other produced compound lava flows that reached the sea. In QGIS , the 2021 Eruption layer group shows you both the vents and the chronology of lava flows provided by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CMS). Identify feature tool By using the Identify Feature tool, you can click on any lava flow outline and see its date field. Using the lava flow outlines, we computed the evolution of flow length and flow width through time as shown in Figure 2. Evolution of the flow field Using the flow outlines in QGIS and Figure 2, estimate: How accurate would have been the steepest descent approach to forecast flow inundation of the 2021 eruption? How different is the actual flow compared to the drainage network? How dynamic is a months-long lava flow? Is it a single event or a compound pulsatory phenomena? What event do you think corresponds to the dashed red line in Figure 2? What happens before and after ? What are the advance and widening rates of the 2021 lava flow? Can you use it to estimate the advance and widening of possible lava flows from other vents? Figure 2: Possible location of vent opening for the next eruption according to Marrero et al. (2019).

This is a broad topic, too broad to be entirely covered here, and some of you might already be familiar with it. For the others, we will try to keep the information to a minimum required for the exercise. Bear in mind that the main use for GIS here will be restricted to visualisation (rather than analyses) of geospatial data. For more information, you can visit these links: QGIS Wikipedia National Geographic ESRI GIS are extensively used in the study of natural hazards and their risks as they allow to analyse the spatial relationship between hazardous phenomena and exposed elements. The objectives of this short introduction are to provide you with the basic GIS knowledge necessary to fully understand the volcanic hazard assessment of the following classes. Specifically, the objectives are: Getting to know the QGIS interface Load data into QGIS Creating and saving maps Some basic GIS concepts The most common GIS most of us use on a daily basis is OpenStreetMap ( OSM for short) or any equivalent. There, a lot of data is stored and georeferenced , meaning that all piece of data has a geospatial reference and is able to be located on the globe's surface. In GIS, datasets are stored in two main forms: vector and raster . Think of it as the same fundamental difference that exists between Illustrator and Photoshop . Vector data OSM contains only vector data, which can be either points , lines (e.g., roads) or polygons (e.g., lakes). For points, a vector GIS data showing some information about some of my favourite Swiss mountains could look like this: Latitude Longitude Name Altitude Canton First ascent 45.976 7.658 Matterhorn 4,478 m Valais 1865 46.034 7.612 Dent Blanche 4,357 m Valais 1862 In this case, the Latitude and Longitude columns hold geographical data, whereas the other columns hold non-geographical attributes. More information is available on the Wikipedia and QGIS websites. Coordinate systems In the example above, we used Latitude and Longitude to express the y and x coordinates of the points. This seems trivial, but actually opens a complex problem which is how to represent a distorted spherical body onto a flat map. This has been a problem since about 650 BCE , and a lot of different projections have been proposed, each with benefits and negative aspects. In any case, in the classes we might refer to either coordinate systems or EPSG (an international code referencing the various projections). More information is available here . Raster data Raster data are stored as a grid of values - or pixels. There is no raster data on OSM , but two common raster datasets are satellite imagery or digital elevation models (or DEM). The main difference with vector datasets is that if you zoom sufficiently, pixels will start to appear. The zoom level at which this effect occurs depends on the raster's resolution , i.e., the size of a given pixel in the x and y directions. More information is available on the QGIS website. QGIS Quantum GIS \u2013 or QGIS \u2013 is an open-source GIS software. We use it as it is free, cross-platform and powerful. A comprehensive documentation on QGIS (and GIS in general ) is available on the QGIS website. The QGIS interface The QGIS interface is shown in Figure 1. Note that the Graphical User Interface (GUI) is highly customisable and might look different at first, but the red numbers indicate the main common components. Figure 1: The QGIS interface The main component of the interface are: Menu bar Toolbars Panels Map view Status bar Let's focus on specific aspects of the GUI.

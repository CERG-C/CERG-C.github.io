# Probabilistic modelling: Part 2

We have [previously](Hazard_probabilistic1.md) looked at probabilistic modeling for lava flows, where we accounted for the uncertainty of vent location on hazard quantification. However, probabilistic hazard assessment strategies often have to account for the uncertainty on **more than one** parameter. This section sets the stage for probabilistic assessment of tephra fallout and digs one step further into the mechanics of probabilistic hazard modeling.

## :material-format-list-checks:{ .icn } Objectives

- Understand how ESP can be translated into **probabilistic eruption scenarios**.
- Learn the mechanics of **probabilistic hazard modelling** for tephra accumulation.
- Review how to **compute** and **display** hazard outputs.
<!-- - Review the concepts of **deterministic**, **scenario-based probabilistic** and **probabilistic** volcanic hazard assessments. -->
  
## :fontawesome-solid-gears:{ .icn } Probabilistic hazard modelling 

For the sake of this exercise, let's consider a [Plinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plinian_eruption) eruption from [Cotopaxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotopaxi) volcano (Ecuador) that occurred ~1200 years ago. By using the [workflow](Hazard_tephra_intro.md#field-mapping-toolbox) previously introduced, we were able to reconstruct the ESP of the eruption[^1].

    <figcaption>Figure 2: Eruption classification using deposit properties using the methods of **a** Bonadonna and Costa (2013) and **b** Pyle (1989).</figcaption>
    </figure>

Based on this, we were able to estimate that **4.5**$\times 10^8\ m^3$ of tephra were erupted from a **25** km-high plume over ~1h, and that the deposit indeed shows the characteristics of a Plinian eruption[^2][^3]. Based on the volume, this eruption had a VEI of 4.

Great. We now have one reference eruption. But is that sufficient to be used as a **representative hazard information** for a future eruption of Cotopaxi volcano?

### The early days: deposit-based hazard maps

For a long time, reference eruptions have been used as representative of the most likely future behaviour, in which case an isopach map such as Figure 1 was used as the hazard map for tephra accumulation. 

!!! question "What do you think is missing??"

    Do you think that this approach represents a comprehensive representation of the possible hazard from future eruptions? Why, or why not? What do you think is missing?

    Spend some time thinking about these aspects in an intuitive way.

??? warning "Missing component #1"

    The [Global Volcanism Program](https://volcano.si.edu) of the Smithsonian Institution is a useful database that attempts to compile the eruptive histories of volcanoes that have been active during the [Holocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene). Let's have a look at the eruptive history of Cotopaxi volcano inferred this database:

    ![gvp](img/cotopaxi/gvp.png){ width="500" }

    **What do we see?**

    - 78 eruptions are recorded in the catalogue.
    - VEI vary between 1 and 5, which mean that during its history, eruptions at Cotopaxi volcano have had:
        - Plume heights varying between 10's of meters to 10's of km.
        - Erupted volumes varying between 10$^{-5}$ to 10$^{1}$ km$^{3}$.

    !!! danger "Lesson #1"

        Using **a single isopach map** implies that we are considering **one realisation** of the scope of eruptive behaviour that a given volcanic system is capable of exhibiting.

??? warning "Missing component #2"

    The tephra fallout hazard extends in the direction of the dominant wind patterns, which [vary in time and space](https://earth.nullschool.net). Let's look at statistics of wind velocity and direction over the past 15 years at a given volcano:

    ![wind](img/cotopaxi/wind.png){ width="500" }

    **What do we see?**

    - Between the **dry** and the **rainy** seasons, the wind direction at this specific volcano can **shift by 180 degrees**.
    - The **rainy** season is characterised by lower wind velocities.

    !!! danger "Lesson #2"

        Using **a single isopach map** implies that we are considering **one realisation** of the possible atmospheric patterns in which a future eruption could occur.

As a summary, the [previous lesson](Hazard_tephra_modeling.md) has provided us with a methodology to **predict tephra accumulation**, but we need to be able to account for **the inherent variability** of ESP when quantifying the associated hazard.

### Probabilistic eruption scenarios

Probabilistic hazard modelling for tephra fallout follows the same general philosophy compared to what we adopted for [lava flows](Hazard_probabilistic1.md) with two notable differences.

1. **Model input &rarr;** For [lava flows](Hazard_probabilistic1.md), we used a *non-physical model*. As a consequence, we explored the uncertainty associated with vent location and the DEM rather than physical properties - or, in other words, ESP. Input parameters to `Tephra2` are, however, physical ESP, and the aim of the probabilistic modelling approach for the tephra hazard will be to **explore a range of possible eruption conditions** for a future event. 

2. **Model output &rarr;** For [lava flows](Hazard_probabilistic1.md), the output of one single run consisted of a boolean inundation/no inundation condition, and the probabilistic approach quantified a **likelihood of pixel inundation** by a lava flow. Conversely, the output of a single `Tephra2` run is a *hazard intensity*, namely a **mass accumulation per surface area** ($kg/m^2$). The probabilistic approach will therefore help us to quantify a **likelihood of a mass at a given pixel to exceed a specific threshold of mass accumulation**. This flowchart illustrates the differences between these approaches:

    B --> B0[[Probabilistic]]--> B3["P(mass at pixel x,y â‰¥ threshold)"]
```

#### Identify ESP ranges

The first step for the probabilistic hazard assessment of tephra fallout is to define an **eruption scenario**. An **eruption scenario** represents what we expect to be a possible future eruption behaviour based on our knowledge of the volcanic system. Concretely, an **eruption scenario** is defined by a **spectrum of possible values** that each **ESP could exhibit** during a future eruption. Probabilistic modeling requires to define ESPs not as **single** but as **distributions** of values, generally defined as:

1. A **range** of values (i.e., the `minimum` and `maximum` values to explore).
2. A **shape** of distribution. 

Let's go back to the Cotopaxi eruption presented above. The **plume height** estimated from the study of the deposit is **25 km**. Based on our *knowledge*, we might postulate that a plume height of **25 km** is indeed likely for a future eruption but want to acknowledge that our level of uncertainty may allow the plume height to vary between 20-30 km. In this case, we might adopt a `normal` distribution as shown in Figure 3.

<figure markdown>
![scenario](img/ESP/ESP-scenarios.png)
<figcaption>Figure 3: Starting from a deterministic (i.e., reference eruption) approach (left), an eruption scenario is defined by i) identifying a range (center) and a distribution (right) for each ESP.</figcaption>
</figure>

We need to repeat this process for all ESP relevant for the model used. For `Tephra2`, we will focus here on `Plume height` and `mass/volume`. 

!!! info "The *how* and *why* of eruption scenarios"

    There is no magic answer on **how** to define eruption scenarios. This depends on a case-per-case basis and is often constrained by such aspects as the knowledge of the volcanic system and/or the purpose of the hazard analysis.

    **Definition**

    Ranges of ESP of a given eruption scenario can be tailored to reflect:

    - A VEI 
    - An eruptive style 
    - An intensity 
    - A reference eruption 

    **Purpose**

    The way an eruption scenario is defined can also reflect the *purpose* of the study. For instance, a long-term hazard study designed for *preparedness* might rely on eruption scenarios that consider wide ranges of EPS and focuses on **epistemic** uncertainties. Conversely, a hazard assessment required for *emergency management* during a crises might be informed by monitoring, and the associated scenario might be defined by narrower ranges of ESP that dominantly focus on the **aleatory** error. 


#### A note on the uncertainty of ESPs 

Choosing the most appropriate *range* and *distribution* for each ESP is **not trivial** and express the uncertainty that we have of what the next eruption will be. We have briefly discussed this at the end of [this module](Hazard_lava_modeling.md), but let's review again what **uncertainties** are and where they are originating from.

Conceptually, uncertainties can be classified in two categories:

!!! example "Uncertainties"

      - **Epistemic uncertainty**  derives from the lack of knowledge regarding a phenomena. In theory, we could reduce epistemic uncertainties if more observations of the phenomena were available to help us better constrain the underlying processes and behaviours.
      - **Aleatoric uncertainty** is associated with the inherent randomness of natural processes. Nothing much we can do about it, really!

Figure 4 illustrates four different **distributions** that have been used in the literature to express ESP variability. These distributions combine both **epistemic** and **aleatoric** uncertainties. Although a better characterisation of the **epistemic** uncertainty would help to refine the *top left* distribution towards a distribution centered on a *best guess* values, the constant presence of an **aleatoric** component of uncertainty is the reason why the *bottom right* distribution is impossible to achieve.

!!! warning "Probability distributions for ESP"

    <figure markdown>
    ![distribution](img/ESP/ESP-distributions.png){width="450px"}
    <figcaption>Figure 4: Illustration of various probability distributions used for EPS sampling</figcaption>
    </figure>

    - The **top left** example is a `uniform` distribution: In this case, any value between `min` and `max` has an **equal probability of occurrence**. This is often referred to as a *maximum level of ignorance*. 
    - The **top right** example is a `normal` distribution: Here we assume that **a central value** has the highest probability of occurrence, but it can divert from it in a **symmetrical** fashion.
    - The **bottom left** example is a `logarithmic` distribution: In this case, we assume that **smaller values** have higher probabilities of occurrence **than larger** ones. For instance, large earthquakes occur more often than small ones. 
    - Finally, the **bottom right** example represent an unrealistic case where `min`=`max`. This would only occur if there was **no uncertainty**.

The critical objective here is to attempt to **translate our knowledge of the volcanic system** into **realistic eruption scenarios**. But **how do we improve our knowledge** and therefore **reduce epistemic uncertainties** around ESPs? 

Pragmatically, there are three main directions to do so:

1. **Field studies &rarr;** Ideally, identifying the range of ESPs is based on **extensive field studies**. By reconstructing the **stratigraphy** of a volcanic edifice, we can study its **past eruptive history**, which is then used to estimate the potential future **eruption scenarios**. 
2. **Literature review &rarr;** This *personal* knowledge is then usually complemented by **published literature**. 
3. **Analogues &rarr;** However, for volcanoes with a poor geological record, it is often necessary to extend our knowledge based on **analogue** volcanoes or eruptions. Despite the development of [dedicated methodologies](https://github.com/BritishGeologicalSurvey/pyvolcans)[^4], this largely remains a *subjective* process. This step often relies on global eruption databases such as [GVP](https://volcano.si.edu)[^5] or [LaMEVE](https://www2.bgs.ac.uk/vogripa/view/controller.cfc?method=lameve)[^6].


#### Eruption scenario for Cotopaxi volcano

Let's go back to the Cotopaxi case and develop an eruption scenario based around this reference eruption. Based on the eruption from Cotopaxi, we defined a **VEI-based** eruption scenario assuming:

1. Volume/mass constraints based on a **VEI 4** eruption &rarr; 0.1â€“1 $km^3$ or 0.1â€“1 $\times 10^{12}\ kg$.
2. Plume heights of 20â€“30 $km$. 
3. Wind conditions based on Reanalysis datasets.

Note that for **1** and **2**, we adopt a **normal** distribution. In this way, we consider that the values obtained from the deposit characterisation are the most likely, but that diverging values also have non-null probabilities of occurrence (albeit less likely).

![scenario0](img/scenario/esp_scenario_0.png)

!!! info "Reanalysis datasets"

    Reanalysis datasets are incredibly useful datasets providing gridded atmospheric conditions at **consistent spatial and temporal resolutions** for the past 5-7 decades. Initially developed to constrain the initial conditions for weather forecasts, we used them in probabilistic tephra modeling to estimate the most likely wind conditions at a given volcano. We typically download 10-20 years of wind, and these datasets provide one wind profile per either 1, 6, 12 or 24 hours. 

    We rely on two main Reanalysis datasets: [ERA5](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5) from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the [NCEP-DOE Reanalysis 2](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis2.html).


### Probabilistic hazard modelling

Now that we have defined the eruption scenario and associated ESPs, let's actually run the probabilistic hazard modeling. Similarly to the approach used for [lava flows](Hazard_probabilistic1.md), we will perform a large number of single model runs. But instead of varying the `vent location`, each run be initiated with **one set** of ESP stochastically sampled from the pre-defined distributions.

The cartoon below illustrates the process. We modeled $n$ runs: here $n=3$, but we would typically used *thousands* of runs to ensure that ESP drawn from each distribution represents a statistically significant sample of the range of possible combinations and outcomes.

=== "Run 1"

    ![scenario0](img/scenario/esp_scenario_1.png)
    ![scenario0](img/scenario/tephra_prob1.png)

=== "Run 2"

    ![scenario0](img/scenario/esp_scenario_2.png)
    ![scenario0](img/scenario/tephra_prob2.png)

=== "Run n"

    ![scenario0](img/scenario/esp_scenario_3.png)
    ![scenario0](img/scenario/tephra_prob3.png)

#### Computing hazard probabilities 

Let's compute probabilities for the following points: `P1`, `P2` and `P3`. 

- Across the 3 runs, `P1` had accumulations of 0 $kg/m^2$ for the first two simulations and 5 $kg/m^2$ for the third one.
- `P2` resulted in accumulations of 15, 12 and 2 $kg/m^2$ over runs 1,2 and 3, respectively. 
- `P3` had accumulations of 7, 5 and 0 $kg/m^2$ for runs 1,2 and 3, respectively.

Let's now consider two tephra accumulation thresholds of 1 and 10 $kg/m^2$. We want to express **how likely** these accumulations are to occur over our set of runs. Let's take two examples:

- Across the 3 runs, an accumulation of 1 $kg/m^2$ at `P1` occurred in 1/3 cases: a future tephra accumulations at `P1` therefore has a 33% probability to exceed a threshold of of 1 $kg/m^2$.
- At `P2`, an accumulation of 10 $kg/m^2$ occurred in 2/3 cases: a tephra accumulation of 10 $kg/m^2$ therefore has a 66% probability of occurrence.

By repeating this approach over all points of the map, it is now possible to represent **the spatial distribution** of hazard. 

!!! note "What probabilities?"

    Again, pay attention to [what these probabilities express](Hazard_probabilistic2.md#probabilistic-eruption-scenarios):

    - In the case of [lava flows](Hazard_probabilistic1.md), one single model run estimates a **boolean** yes/no inundation for each pixel, and the probabilistic approach quantifies a **probability of flow inundation** (&rarr; one single map). 
    - In the case of tephra deposits, one single model run estimates a **continuous** hazard intensity (i.e., mass of tephra per unit area). The probabilistic approach quantifies a **probability of accumulation to exceed** specific masses per unit area. Therefore, the output for probabilistic hazard assessment for tephra accumulation consists of **multiple maps** (&rarr; one map per accumulation threshold). 

!!! info "Formalising probability computation"

    We have defined an eruption scenario $E$, and we now want to compute the probability $P$ of a given geographic point $x,y$ to be subject to mass accumulations $M$ exceeding a given accumulation threshold $M_T$:

    $$ P[M(x,y) \geqslant M_T \mid E] $$

    This probability $P$ is computed using a simple *frequentist* approach: We simply divide the number of simulations that resulted in an accumulation exceeding the considered threshold (&rarr; $M(x,y) \geqslant M_T$) by the total number of runs:

    $$ P(x,y) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N_{r}}n_{i}}{N_{r}} $$

    Where $N_{r}$ is the total number of runs and $n_{i}$ is defined as:

    $$ n_{i} = \bigg\{ ^{1, if M(x,y) \geqslant threshold \mid run} _{0, otherwise} $$

!!! warning "*Conditional* probabilities"

    The equations above highlight that the probability $P$ is **conditional to the occurrence of the eruption scenario**. For now, we are only considering this question:

    > What is the probability of a given geographic point to suffer tephra accumulations exceeding $x\ kg/m^2$ **given that the eruption scenario E is occurring**. 

    Bear that in mind. We'll get back to this later.

#### Hazard outputs

We now have a framework to quantify **hazard occurrence** probabilistically, but how do we turn this *information* into a useful *knowledge*? Let's look at the different methods available to *display* probabilistic hazard analyses.

For tephra fallout, we have **4 quantities** to represent that are:

- `Latitude` and `longitude`. 
- `Tephra accumulation`. 
- `Probability of occurrence`.

However, it is difficult to represent more than **3 quantities** on such a 2D canvas as a map, and we therefore need to **fix one quantity**, which provides us with 3 different approaches to express hazard. 

!!! example "Method 1: Probabilistic hazard maps"

    &rarr; Fixed threshold of **tephra accumulation**.

    &rarr; Other quantities are expressed continuously. 

    &rarr; Display the spatial distribution of exceedence probabilities **of a single threshold of tephra accumulation** (i.e., there are as many maps as accumulation thresholds). 


!!! example "Method 2: Probabilistic isomass maps"

    &rarr; Fixed threshold of **exceedence probability**.

    &rarr; Other quantities are expressed continuously. 

    &rarr; Display the spatial distribution of tephra accumulation **for a single exceedence probability value** (i.e., there are as many maps as probability values). 

!!! example "Method 3: Hazard curves"

    &rarr; Fixed latitude and longitude.

    &rarr; Other quantities are expressed continuously. 

    &rarr; Display the probability of occurrence of a given tephra accumulation **for a single location** (i.e., there are as many curves as points of interest). 

Is the difference between **probability** and **isomass** maps are? Lets look at these sketches:

=== "Graphically..."

    ![pim1](img/pim/prob2im1.png)

    - On the left, **probabilistic hazard maps** quantify the probability to exceed a mass accumulation. Contours show **equal probabilities**.
    - On the right, **probabilistic isomass maps** show the mass accumulation occurring for a given probability. Contours show **equal accumulations**. 

    Therefore, both maps show the same information but emphasise different quantities.

=== "More formally..."

    ![pim2](img/pim/prob2im2.png)

    Probabilistic hazard modelling estimates the tephra accumulations at a given pixel $x,y$ for all of the $n$ runs (here, $n=5$). 

    - To produce **probabilistic hazard maps**, we adopt the frequentist approach previously described and calculate the probability to exceed a given mass accumulation &rarr; e.g., this pixel has a 3/5 = 60% probability of exceeding a tephra accumulation of 10 $kg/m^2$.
    - To produce **probabilistic isomass maps**, we estimate the **inverse** of an **empirical cumulative density function** (i.e., the survivor function) using all modelled accumulations &rarr; e.g., the accumulation associated with a 25% exceedence probability is 36 $kg/m^2$.

!!! info "Rule of thumb"

    Bear in mind: **large** tephra accumulations usually have **lower** probabilities of occurrence than **smaller** accumulations.

## :material-thought-bubble:{ .icn } Hazard output example

Let's change volcanoes and continents: The examples below illustrate a hazard assessment for a VEI 4 Plinian eruption at [Sakurajima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakurajima) volcano[^7] in Japan, developed around the 1914 Taisho eruption[^8]. Note that the hazard modeling procedure was exactly the same as for Cotopaxi.

=== "Probability maps"

    These maps show the spatial probability to exceed accumulations of 1 (left) and 100 (right) $kg/m^2$. The top and bottom maps illustrate the impact of wind variability on the computed dispersal as a function of the season. The general dispersal is towards the E, but the summer shows a higher variability in directions and lower wind velocities, increasing the hazard on the city of Kagoshima (point number 3).

    ![sk1](img/sakurajima/prob.png)

=== "Isomass maps"

    These maps show the typical tephra accumulations for probabilities of occurrences of 25% (left) and 75% (right). Compared to probability maps, we can use the famous saying used in SE Asia: *Same same, but different*.

    ![sk2](img/sakurajima/im.png)

=== "Hazard curves"

    This plot shows hazard curves computed for three different locations (see the maps for reference):

    1. Tarumizu City Hall
    2. Kagoshima airport
    3. Tarumizu central station

    Curves show a continuous relationship between tephra accumulation and their respective probabilities of occurrences. The advantage of hazard curves is that they can represent **more than a single eruption scenario**, which helps comparison. For instance, these plots contain the modelling of the VEI 4 eruption scenario using wind profiles for i) all seasons combined (solid line), the summer (dashed line) and spring, fall and winter (dotted line). 

    To read these plots, start by identifying one tephra accumulation for which you want to estimate the associated probability of occurrence. From the plot's x axis, go straight up until the intersection with the curve representing the scenario of interest. From the point of intersection, go straight left and read the probability value on the y axis.

    For instance, the Tarumizu City Hall has a ~8% probability of exceeding accumulations of 100 $kg/m^2$ following a VEI 4 eruption of Sakurajima volcano.

    ![sk3](img/sakurajima/curves.png)


<!-- ## Various approaches for hazard assessment

### Deterministic scenarios

**Deterministic** hazard assessments: Usually based on past events, they express the hazard should *the exact same event* happen again in the future. As we have seen, this is impossible, and, in the end, this approach fails to account for and quantify uncertainties. However, their benefit is that they are easy to communicate with decision makers. Deterministic scenarios are mostly used for the development of contingency plans in contexts, **only when** a well-established communication channel exists between monitoring agencies, decision-makers and stakeholders. 

### Scenario-based

# How do lavas flow?

### When will the flow stop?

- Option 1: Reaching a given distance 
  - Arbitrary
  - Calibrated
  - Probability distribution based on differences in elevation

### How wide will the flow get?


## How do lavas flow?

- To simplify complex physics to a maximum, **lava flows** are non-newtonian fluids with a **yield strength**. 
- A **yield strength** means that you need to apply a *load* on the fluid before it starts deforming.

!!! question "Yield strength"

    Think of a slope. If you drop a newtonian fluid (i.e., no yield strength) on it, it will immediately start flowing, whereas non-newtonian fluids with a yield strength will require some help.

    Can you think of any fluids that would behave like these?

    ??? check "Solution"

        - **Water** is a newtonian fluid with no yield strength 
        - **Toothpaste** is a non-newtonian fluids with a yield strength

- Advance rate:
    - Volumetric effusion rate 
    - Proximity to the vent
- Flow length
    - Eruption rate (both magnitude and steadiness)
    - Slope traversed
    - Extent of topographic confinement
    - Initial lava temperature and rheological properties 
    - Emplacement conditions (open channel or insulating tube)

# Q-LavHA

With the knowledge gained on [topographic controls](Hazard_lava_steepest-descent.md) and [modeling](Hazard_lava_modeling.md) gained from the previous exercise, we will now look at `Q-LavHA`[^1] as an alternative approach for probabilistic hazard assessments for lava flow inundation. This part of the exercise assumes that you have already [installed](Hazard_lava_config.md) both `QGIS` and `Q-LavHA`. The [Q-LavHA user manual](files/Usersguide_Q-LavHA_V3_2020.pdf) contains some important information about how to configure the model and the data, so we encourage you to have a look at it at some point.

## :fontawesome-solid-gears:{ .icn } Theory behind Q-LavHA 

### Flow direction 

The starting philosophy behind `Q-LavHA` is similar to the analysis performed for the [path of steepest descent](Hazard_lava_steepest-descent.md#flow-accumulation) approach: the DEM, the model will try to estimate *where* the flow will go next based on the maximum $\Delta h$ of the surrounding pixels. However, `Q-LavHA` uses a probabilistic approach to estimate this flow direction. 

Firstly, as we saw, a lava flow is a viscous fluid with yield strength, which means that it can *escape* the steepest path and propagate laterally, fill depressions and overcome topographical obstacles. To account for that, `Q-LavHA` introduces 2 corrective factors:

- $H_c$, representing the flow *thickness*.
- $H_p$, representing the ability of a flow to *inflate*. 

Together, these two parameters help avoiding the modelled flow getting stuck in topographic low and will allow it to spread laterally, as we saw the 2021 flow of La Palma was able to do. 

Secondly, the initial estimation of path of steepest descent is performed *stochastically* similarly to what we [previously looked at](Hazard_probabilistic1.md). Conceptually, one `Q-LavHA` output is constituted by the simulation of **thousands** of lava flows (1500 by default). Each lava flow simulation applies a path of steepest descent approach, but the selection of the next pixel is performed slightly differently:

1. At each new pixel, the $H_c$ and $H_p$ corrections are applied to the active pixel according to Figure 1.
2. Instead of selecting the pixel with the largest $|\Delta h|$ as [previously seen](Hazard_lava_steepest-descent.md#flow-accumulation), `Q-LavHA` assigns a *relative probability* of flow inundation to each surrounding pixel (see box below). 
3. Using a *random number* generator, `Q-LavHA` stochastically sample *which pixel* will be inundated next. With this approach, the pixel with the largest $|\Delta h|$ has the highest probability of being inundated next, but other pixel also have a non-null probability of inundation. 

??? info "Path of steepest descent in Q-LavHA"

    By default, `Q-LavHA` computes a relative probability across the 8 surrounding pixels using $\Delta h^2$ according to:

    $$
    P_i^2 = \frac{(\Delta h_i)^2}{\sum_{j=1}^{8} (\Delta h_i)^2}, i=1,2,\ldots,8
    $$

    If potential topographic obstacles are not overcome by the application of $H_c$ and $H_p$ around the **8** surrounding pixels, `Q-LavHA` extends its search to the next **16** surrounding pixels. `Q-LavHA` then transforms these relative probabilities into a cumulative probability function $S_i$:

    $$
    S_i = \sum_{j=1}^{i} P_j, i=1,2,\ldots,8
    $$

    A random number $rnd$ is then drawn in the $[0, 1[$ interval, and used to select the corresponding pixel in the range $[S_{i-1}, Si[$:

    $$
    S_{i-1} \leq rnd \leq S_i, i=1,2,\ldots,8
    $$

### Flow length 

Flow length is a critical metrics of lava flow hazard. However, since it depends on a complex interaction between eruption conditions at the source, flow rheology and topography through time and space, modelling the case-per-case physics of each flow is unrealistic in hazard assessment contexts. For this reason, `Q-LavHA` proposes three alternatives to compute maximum flow length: 

1. A maxiumum user defined length, using either [Euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) or [Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) distances.
2. A decreasing probability function based on existing flow databases.
3. The cooling-limited flow model FLOWGO[^2].

!!! note "Lava flow distance"

    As you can see from the <a href="../files/GeologicalmapofLaPalma.pdf", target="_blank">geological map of La Palma</a>, most historical flows on the island have reached the sea, so we will consider here that the flow distance is of limited importance. This assumption is however invalid in most cases. The **probability function** option allows you define a probability of flow length based on a **mean** and **standard** deviation of known lava flows length, which is a convenient way to treat this parameter probabilistically. Refer to the original paper[^1] for more information.

### Probability of flow inundation 

As [previously seen](Hazard_probabilistic1.md#probabilistic-modelling), probability of lava flow inundation $P$ at a given pixel $i, j$ is generally computed as the number of inundation counts $n_i$ normalised by the number of runs $N_r$:

$$
P(x,y) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N_{r}}n_{i}}{N_{r}}
$$

Where $N_{r}$ is the total number of runs and $n_{i}$ is defined as:

$$
n_{i} = \bigg\{ ^{1,\ if\ inundation} _{0,\ otherwise}
$$

Depending on the modeling options adopted, `Q-LavHA` will slightly modify this approach. Refer to the original paper[^1] for more information.

!!! warning "Install Q-LavHA"

    ![Image title](img/qgis/qlavha.png){width=40, align=left }
    Start by making sure that `Q-LavHA` has been properly installed according to [this guide](Hazard_lava_config.md). You should see this icon in the toolbar.


- In the `Lava Flow exercise` layer group in `QGIS`, activate the `Vents Exercise` layer.

### Running Q-LavHA for single vents

These vents correspond to those indicated in the Table below. `Q-LavHA` requires [projected UTM coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system), which are shown in the `Easting` and `Northing` columns (`x` and `y` columns, respectively). The UTM zone for La Palma is `28N`, or [EPSG:3268](https://epsg.io/32628).


| Vent   | Latitude  | Longitude | Easting (m) | Northing (m) | EPSG  |
|:-------|:----------|:----------|:------------|:-------------|:------|
| Vent 1 | -17.83989 | 28.62507  | 222340      | 3169746      | 32628 |
| Vent 2 | -17.86626 | 28.61262  | 219728      | 3168426      | 32628 |
| Vent 3 | -17.84316 | 28.58782  | 221922      | 3165623      | 32628 |
| Vent 4 | -17.81585 | 28.60777  | 224646      | 3167772      | 32628 |
| Vent 5 | -17.84649 | 28.49699  | 221357      | 3155562      | 32628 |

!!! warning "Coordinate systems" 

    Here, you are provided with input data that **all have the same coordinate system**. Before modeling lava flows for your own projects, make sure that you first [reproject](https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/training_manual/processing/crs.html?highlight=reproject) all your data to a **unique** [CRS](https://epsg.io). 

#### Model setup


Let's run `Q-LavHA` for each of the vents defined above. For now, we will assume that we know *exactly* the vent location. Open the `Q-LavHA` window, and let's look at the parameters:

=== "Vent location tab"

    1. In the `DEM Selection` box, select the `Data/Lava/DEM_Qlavah.tif`. In the DEM selection window, make sure you change the type of files from `.asc` to `.tif`.
    2. As a `Vent Type`, choose `Point` for now.
    3. Add the relevant `Coordinates`.

=== "Lava flow parameter tab" 

    1. `Lava Flow Propagation`: This section sets up the behaviour of the lava flow, as described in the theory section. 
       
         - Leave the default values of `Hc` and `Ht`.
         - Use the `H16` option: This means that the algorithm will first search for a topographic low within the first 8 adjacent pixels, and will extend the search to the next 16 ones if not found.
         - Use `Probability to the square`

    2. `Lava Flow Length Constrain`: This section defines *when* a lava flow stops. You can switch between the various options for an illustration of the different behaviours. As discussed above, use a `Manhattan Distance` with a length of `10000 m`. 
    3. `Simulations`: Use a `Number of iterations` of 1500. This represents the number of simulated lava flows, or $N_r$ in the equations above.

=== "Output files tab" 

    1. Set an `Output path` and a `name` to the output layers. 
    2. Save the `Parameters`. 

**You are now ready to run the simulation!**

??? info "Vent geometry"

    `Q-LavHA` offers different source geometries, such as a fissure, or a vent opening susceptibility map. The choice of these options depends on the case study, and their use is described in the [Q-LavHA user manual](files/Usersguide_Q-LavHA_V3_2020.pdf).

#### Styling outputs 

Upon completion of the model run, the output file is directly added to the layer panel. Let's change its visualisation:

- Open the `Layer Properties` panel by double-clicking on the output layer in the `Layers` panel.
- From the `Symbology` tab on the left:
    - Under `Color Rendering`, uncheck the `Colorize` option.
    - Under `Render type`, choose `Singleband pseudocolor`. 
    - Set the `min` and `max` values to 0 and 0.5, respectively. 
    - Change the `Color ramp` to `Magma`
- Click ok.

The output file now shows the **spatial distribution** of **inundation probability** varying between $\gt 0$ and $0.5$ (i.e., 50%). 

??? note "Copying layer symbology"

    In `QGIS`, it you can simply copy the display properties of one layer to other layers: 
    
    - In the `Layers` panel, right-click on the layer you want to copy the style *from* and select `Styles > Copy style`.
    - Now right-click on the layer you want to apply to style on and select `Styles > Paste style`.

    ![copy styles](img/qgis/copy_styles.png){width=500}

#### Analysing results 

Following this procedure, run `Q-LavHA` for **all the vents specified in the Table above** and apply the same symbology. Answer the following questions:

!!! question "Question 1: Single-vent simulations"

    1. How do modelled flows compare to <a href="../files/GeologicalmapofLaPalma.pdf", target="_blank">historical lava flows</a> in terms of length and width?
    2. Analyse and discuss the spatial distribution of inundation probability. How do they compare to flow accumulation rasters and the path of steepest descent approach?
    3. Where do branching occur?
    4. Chose *one vent* for which you will produce another run with the same parameters as above. Are they **exactly** the same? If not, why?
    5. Compare simulations from **vent 2** with the flow outlines of the 2021 eruption. **When** and **where** is the model doing a good job? **When** and **where** is it not? Why?


### Using several vents

Even in *monogenetic vents*, one eruptive episode can consist of multiple satellite vents. This was certainly the case for the 2021 eruption of La Palma. In fact, as you can see from the `2021 Vents` layer in `QGIS`, [CEMS](https://emergency.copernicus.eu/mapping/list-of-components/EMSR546) identified that ~10 vents opened over a 500 x 500 m area. Here, we won't attempt predicting the **number** or the **location** of each vent; instead, we will model lava flow inundation from **a grid of vents** within a surface area and explore how vent location affects the lava flow simulation hazard. 

!!! warning "(Not) one vent to rule them all"

    You've each been assigned **one** of the vents defined in the table above. Since this step takes more computational time, please run this procedure only for this vent. 

#### Define the area 

We will define a potential vent opening surface as a 500 x 500 m square centered on the reference coordinates of your attributed vent. Note that UTM coordinates are in *meter*: you can therefore simply identify the `x` and `y` coordinates these four points by addition and subtraction:

- Lower left corner 
- Lower right corner 
- Upper right corner
- Upper left corner

#### Model setup

- From `QGIS` open `Q-LavHA`. Most of the parameters should already be filled. Otherwise, you can use the `Load parameters` option.
- Set a `Distance between vents` of 100 m. Since we definerd a 500 x 500 m area, `Q-LavHA` will therefore model lava flow inundation from 25 vents. 
- Enter the 4 coordinates previously defined.
- In the `Lava Flow Parameter` tab, change the `Number of Simulations` to 500. This will help save some computation time.
- Make sure you change the output name.

**Run the model!**

#### Analysing results

Apply the same methodology to the surface area runs as you did for the point run. 

!!! question "Question 2: Vent location uncertainty"

    1. Compare the run with its single-vent counterpart. How do they differ and why?


### Prepare your hazard maps

### Forecasting the flows from the 2021 eruption

Compare the `Q-LavHA` run with the flow outlines from the 2021 eruption below. Note that the `Q-LavHA` run was performed using the same 500 x 500 m source area as used above.

=== "Flow outlines"

    ![Q-LavHA2021](img/qlavha/2021_outlines.png)


!!! question "Question 3: Interpreting hazard forecasts"

    1. From what you know about both the 2021 eruption and the dynamics of lava flows, compare and discuss the hazard forecast and the actual deposit. What are `Q-LavHA`'s strengths and limitations?
